[mp4info](https://github.com/arbarlow/ruby-mp4info) thinks that my 5 minute Bob Newhart track is 2 seconds long. Looks like that is an issue on several tracks. I need to dig into that, see why [Perl](../../../card/Perl.md)'s MP4::Info picks up the correct length but the [Ruby](../../../card/Ruby.md) counterpart does not.
