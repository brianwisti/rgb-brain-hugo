Just don't even ask. I am in a highly fickle phase with the Web site.

<!--more-->

Despite an excellent suggestion from [Miguel Grinberg](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/) to try [Frozen Flask](http://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/), I am too far along in this week of [Jekyll](../../../card/Jekyll.md) to change  my mind now.

Maybe next week.

It is tempting to write a lengthy blog post describing everything I did to  integrate the old [coolnamehere](../../../card/coolnamehere.md) pages, get a breadcrumb trail on every page, set up tags, and the rest. I am not in the mood. There are other things I want to write about. Heck, I may have this site published via  yet another tool next week. I will just list the resources that made it  easier to assemble the site in its current form with Jekyll.

* This [Trường TX blog post](https://truongtx.me/2012/12/27/jekyll-create-a-list-of-lastest-posts) helped me list the latest posts on every page
* I put the [Jekyll variables](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/) documentation to extensive use.
* Over on the [Biosphere blog](http://biosphere.cc/software-engineering/jekyll-breadcrumbs-navigation-plugin/) was a post for building a basic breadcrumb trail.
* [Charlie Park](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/) wrote about making tag indexes in Jekyll. That was handy.
* a [gist by nimbupani](https://gist.github.com/nimbupani/1421828) showed how to put the latest post contents on the blog index.
