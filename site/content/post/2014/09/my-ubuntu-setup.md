I installed [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) 14.04 on a partition of my laptop today. This is not a novelty. What *is* unusual is the fact that today I decided to track what I installed before I felt like I had a "Minimum Viable Linux." Turns out there was quite a bit.

<!--more-->

* [ack](http://beyondgrep.com/) because I prefer it over grep for searching file contents.
* [Emacs](../../../card/Emacs.md) because it's become my default text editor.
* [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com)
* *Git*
* [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
* [BitTorrent Sync](http://getsync.com/) because me and my free range artisanal lifestyle are too cool for Dropbox.
* [Unity Tweak Tool](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/unity-tweak-tool/)
* [Gnome Tweak Tool](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gnome-tweak-tool/)
* [rvm](http://rvm.io) for [Ruby](../../../card/Ruby.md)
  * Whatever gets installed by `rvm requirements`
* [Perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) for [Perl](../../../card/Perl.md)
* [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for [Node.js](../../../card/Node.js.md)
* [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for [Python](../../../card/Python.md)
* [postgresql](http://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Heroku Toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#set-up)
* [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home)
* [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/)
* [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/)
* [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) to prevent insanity, or at least redirect it.

Other things will be installed, of course. I'll probably add the official Oracle JDK, Inkscape, and assorted other things. And many things will be installed via package managers for the assorted languages I play with. This list is just the core things I need to feel comfortable and ready to work.
