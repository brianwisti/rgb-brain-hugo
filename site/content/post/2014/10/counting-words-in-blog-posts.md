title: Counting Words in Blog Posts

I want to write at least 250 words per day. This is not a 30 day challenge. It is just something I want to do. I write more than 250 words daily when you count social network posts and chat text. Wouldn't it be nice if some of those words were organized around a single idea?

<!--more-->

I need some way to count those words, of course. The obvious solution is \[wc\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wc\_(Unix).

````
$ wc counting-words.markdown
     106     464    3108 counting-words.markdown
````

The documentation tells me that the first column is the number of lines, the second column is the number of words, and the third column is the number of characters. I can train my brain to remember this, but instead I use the `-w` flag to get *only* the word count.

````
$ wc -w counting-words.markdown
     464 post.markdown
````

That is better, but it is not an accurate word count. I am currently using [Jekyll](../../../card/Jekyll.md) for blogging, and every blog post file includes a section of [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) a section of [Markdown](../../../card/Markdown.md) content. My goal is 250 words of prose, not 250 total words. I do not want to count the front matter.

I could use assorted shell tools to accomplish this, but I would rather make a [Ruby](../../../card/Ruby.md) one-liner.

First I get the basic information I was already getting from `wc`.

````
$ ruby -e 'puts ARGF.read.split.count' counting-words.markdown
464
````

How do I separate the head from the body of the post? I could do some fiddly bits using [ARGF.readlines](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/ARGF.html#method-i-readlines) with a separator argument, but I will keep going with what I have.

````
$ ruby -e 'puts ARGF.read.split(/^---$/).inspect' counting-words.markdown
["", "\nlayout: post\ntitle: Counting Words in Blog Posts\ndescription: Using Ruby to track my verbosity\ncategory: Programming\ndate: 2014-10-02\ntags: ruby\n", "\nI want to write at least 250 words per day. ..."]
````

How many words are in the body?

````
$ ruby -e 'puts ARGF.read.split(/^---$/)[-1].split.count' counting-words.markdown
317
````

I did say that I wanted my word count to be prose. I should exclude code blocks. That calls for a multi-line regular expression, stripping out the fenced code blocks in my post.

````
$ ruby -e 'puts ARGF.read.split(/^---$/)[-1].gsub(/^~~~ .+?^~~~ $/m, "").split.count' counting-words.markdown
357
````

I do not want to count link definitions either.

````
$ ruby -e 'puts ARGF.read.split(/^---$/)[-1].gsub(/^~~~ .+?^~~~ |\[.+?\]:.+?$/m, "").split.count' counting-words.markdown
341
````

This is good enough. Now I turn it into a bash alias.

````bash
# words in post / work in progress
alias wip='ruby -e '"'"'puts ARGF.read.split(/^---$/)[-1].gsub(/^(~~~ .+?^~~~ |\[.+?\]:.+?)$/m, "").split.count'"'"
````

Oh jeez those quotes hurt my brain. It was the first solution I came across to handle [shell quoting](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1250279/285810), though. I may come up with something prettier. Perhaps a full script or looking for an existing tool. This will do for now.

````
$ wip counting-words.markdown
341
````

My one-liner ended up choking on some Markdown combinations, so I
turned it into a tiny script.

````ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

ignored_blocks = %r{
  (?: ^~~~ .+?^~~~ $)       # fenced code blocks
  |                         # or
  (?: ^\[ [^\]]+? \]: .+?$) # link definitions
}mx

puts ARGF.read.split(/^---$/)[-1].gsub(ignored_blocks, "").split.count
````

I needed that `/x` flag to make sense of my regular expressions.
