I'm working on tying together the blog and my site. A little [JQuery](http://jquery.com) magic expands the [RSS](../../../card/RSS.md) feed of the [Blogger](../../../card/Blogger.md) blog for visitors to [coolnamehere](../../../card/coolnamehere.md). I'll improve the integration over time, probably by adjusting the template used for the blog. Meanwhile, I have more incentive to use Blogger.

I'll probably add feeds from other services to the site, such as *Buzz* or Twitter. I use those frequently, and they are great for the short thoughts that don't belong in either a blog post or a static page.
