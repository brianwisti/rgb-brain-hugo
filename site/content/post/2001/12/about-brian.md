This page exists for historical purposes — so you can see the cute old picture of me. More current versions of its information is in [about](../../../page/about.md), [follow](../../../page/follow.md), and [now](../../../page/now.md).

Just want to contact me? That’s easy enough.

My name is Brian Wisti, and I am a geek. This site should provide plenty of evidence for that. I write code for a living, and often write code as a hobby.

I was born in 1972, in Tacoma, Washington. That’s in the northwestern United States for those of you reading this from a great distance. I’ve been living in Seattle, Washington since 1999, after quite a few years living in different places. Seattle is a great city to be in, but I wouldn’t mind visiting a lot of other places before I die.

I have more hobbies than I know what to do with. These days, I spend a lot of time programming, knitting, or drawing. I spend more time programming, but it’s hard to tell whether I’ve been programming or drawing for more time. They both seem to satisfy my general urge to create something. From other people, each gets a different reaction. More people go "oh, cool" at my drawings. More people are willing to pay me for my programming. My wife mainly benefits from the knitting, with an endless supply of things I want her to wear. So I get to do all the things I enjoy and stay very happy.
