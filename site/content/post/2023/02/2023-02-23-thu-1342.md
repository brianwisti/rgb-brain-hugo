Been getting deeper into [SiYuan Note](https://b3log.org/siyuan) lately. It's neat, and offers synchronization through Amazon S3 or any compatible service. Compatible?
Well heck. Didn't know that there's something out there S3 enough without being S3.

Using Digital Ocean [Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces) for the last month or two. Now I want to try self-hosted. Hopefully I can set up [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr) on my Raspberry Pi 4.
