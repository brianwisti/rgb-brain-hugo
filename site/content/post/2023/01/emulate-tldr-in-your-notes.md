title: Emulate tldr instead of man in your notes

A bullet point is a note given the right tag

[tldr](../../../card/tldr.md): Emulate [`tldr`](https://tldr.ostera.io/tar) instead of [`man`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html) in your notes.

I still use my PKMs wrong. Keep your notes small. Stick with one tool. Stay focused. Yep, none of that.

But I *have* learned that emulating man page style isn't great. I have big notes on commands with every option, every subcommand, and every subcommand's option.

Then I'd end up searching online how to do a thing. Because I wasn't using a searchable style.

Few months ago I had a moment of enlightenment. Most of what I want in my knowledge garden is to track *processes* — how to do a specific thing. Why not make the notes reflect that?

Use clear language directly relevant to the task at hand. Tag them appropriately with a key tag like "process". You do end up with a lot of notes — or a lot of bullet points, if you use an outliner like [Logseq](../../../card/Logseq.md).

````markdown
- Use Rclone to pull *from* a Dropbox folder #process
 - ```sh
   rclone sync dropbox:Settings ~/Dropbox/Settings
   ```
- Use Rclone to push *to* a Dropbox folder #process
 - ```sh
   rclone sync ~/Dropbox/Settings dropbox:Settings
   ```
````

But they will be easier to find a few months later when all you can remember is "something something [Rclone](https://rclone.org/) something [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/)".

![Logseq search results with example bullets at top of the list](attachments/img/2023/2023-01-31-rclone-search.png "There it is!")

I had these particular processes in the main page for Rclone, but most are scattered throughout my journal pages. It makes no difference, since I use the tag consistently.
