Hey do you want a 37 minute info dump about digital color? Of course you do.

![Your Colors Suck (it's not your fault)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-wlo8yVhk)

 > 
 > Topics covered include: Quantization, color banding, dithering, value mapping, palette swapping, radiometry, photometry, how humans perceive color, colorimetry, spectral rendering, the rgb color model, deriving srgb, the hsl color model, gradient mapping, randomly generated color palettes, perceptual color spaces, the lab color model, oklab

[tldw](../../../card/tldw.md): use [OKLAB](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) not RGB or HSL. Thereâ€™s even [`+oklab()+`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklab) in CSS now.
