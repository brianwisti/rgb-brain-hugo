Decentraland as a sad shadow of Second Life. Non-tech folks reporting on it from the perspective of maybe they’re missing something — but there’s nothing to miss. Oh and the wallet-based voting. More committees than a liberal arts college town’s anarchist collective. Ugh.

But the cat on the couch is the real star of the show.
