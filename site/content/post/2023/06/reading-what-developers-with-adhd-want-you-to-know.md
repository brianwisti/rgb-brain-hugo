Installed [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) on the most recent [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com) [^1] install so I could run my script that adds a post to my site's primary [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) iteration as I work on a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) iteration of the site so I can convincingly claim knowledge of [React](https://react.dev) [^2] when talking to recruiters during this year's interminable [job search](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwisti/) so I can get a new job and maybe get back on [ADHD](../../../card/ADHD.md) meds and maybe occasionally focus on one thing at a time and — um — where was I?

Oh right! I saw an interesting post!

In fact, ADHD is an invisible disability, which is exactly what it sounds like: “a physical, mental or neurological condition that is not visible from the outside, yet can limit or challenge a person’s movements, senses, or activities” (Invisible Disabilities Association). Plenty of forms of neurodivergence, including autism spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and learning differences can be considered invisible disabilities.

It's not in-depth or anything, but offers a little pushback to the "ADHD is a superpower" myth. That myth is handy for the occasional self-help pep talk — "I'm good enough. I'm smart enough. And gosh-darn it, this funky brain wiring is a superpower!" — but it's not true. The self-awareness and arsenal of coping techniques like task automation can look impressive to the untrained eye.
Those only give roughly the same functionality as a normal person going about a normal day. And oh goodness if you're in a context where those techniques aren't helpful? You've got unpartitioned tasks with a poorly defined goal that is important and kinda urgent, but stretched over months?[^3] The floundering.

And let's not even get into the [Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-way-adhd/202106/adhd-and-rejection-sensitivity-dysphoria) aspect.

Anyways the dog needs to go out and I should probably eat breakfast and I think I mentioned something about React. Back to it!

And maybe check email.

[^1]: because I accidentally killed my Windows install and haven't had sufficient executive function to fix it

[^2]: I've used React at work some, but my brain needs the ritual of incorporating a tool or framework into my site building work flow before it'll let me say "yes I know that"

[^3]: like job hunting for example
