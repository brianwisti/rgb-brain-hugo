I just saw Petr Krenzelok's giddy announcement on the [REBOL](../../../card/REBOL.md) mailing list that a public alpha of REBOL 3 is available today. I've been waiting to see this for a while and can't even begin to describe how excited I am. 

<!--more-->

The official announcement is [here](http://www.rebol.com/article/0347.html) I just need to remember that it's an alpha. Pieces aren't going to work. Things will be strange. But it's out there for the bold to play with.

Of course I gotta get some work done, but you can be sure I'll be poking at this over the next couple of days.
