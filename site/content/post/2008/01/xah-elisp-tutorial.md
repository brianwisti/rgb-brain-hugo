I'd *really* love to master an editor. Any editor. Vim has been my weapon of choice for years, but [Emacs](../../../card/Emacs.md) has always intrigued me. It's easier to use than Vim, but the Elisp language is the real draw. Vim's configuration / scripting language is awkward at best. Elisp is cryptically lispish, but at least it is possible to break it down without wondering what the heck `<sfile>` is supposed to be.

So yeah. I'm mostly a Vim guy but I'd love to get more out of my Emacs sessions. With that in mind, I'll be taking a close look at Xah's [Emacs](http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs.html) and [Elisp](http://xahlee.org/emacs/elisp.html) tutorials.
