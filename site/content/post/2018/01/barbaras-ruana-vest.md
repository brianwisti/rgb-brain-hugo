The [Ruana Style Vest](http://www.redheart.com/free-patterns/ruana-style-vest) from Red Heart was one of my more ambitious knitting projects. Took me a little over six months, including a few long breaks and a couple extended bursts of quick knitting that ended up requiring more long breaks. Watch those wrists when you knit!
