I wanted to see my own take on the [Vegvísir](https://norse-mythology.org/vegvisir/), an Icelandic symbol also called a "Nordic Compass".

After a *lot* of work my favorite part was the underlying rough line work. So I kept that and scrapped the rest.

I will probably make more attempts drawing this symbol. Read up on it studying mythology, folklore, and symbolism when I was a kid, then forgot about it until it started cropping up in my life recently. This will do for a start though.

All I know for sure about the Vegvísir is this description from the 19th Century [Huld manuscript](https://www.academia.edu/13008560/Huld_Manuscript_of_Galdrastafir_Witchcraft_Magic_Symbols_and_Runes_-_English_Translation).

Who wouldn't like that?
