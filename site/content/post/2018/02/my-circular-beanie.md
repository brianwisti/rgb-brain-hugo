I made myself a snug beanie hat by *inbox/Knitting* in the round.

I knit a [ski beanie](../../2017/11/my-ski-beanie.md) back in November, using a pattern from [Son of Stitch 'n Bitch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170305.Son_of_Stitch_n_Bitch). The hat fit loose. I thought this might be because the pattern is knit flat. I produce a tighter gauge when knitting in the round. Would adapting the same hat to circular knitting produce a better fit?

Yes â€“ quite a bit! The yarn thickness and needle size were the same as the previous attempt. If I were to try this experiment again I might use the next needle size up. A perfect fit would be somewhere in between this and the beanie from November.
