Well, I've been learning an awful lot about the [TCL](https://web.archive.org/web/20030730132927/http://www.tcl.tk/) language recently. It's another one of those languages that gets used all the time, but anyone who doesn't use it seems to hate it with a passion. I can't see why - TCL seems very easy to get started with. Anyways, I've been messing with that. If TCL seems cool enough after a few weeks, I might add a TCL section to the Geekery pages.

Other than that, not much. I'm glad [Michael Moore](https://web.archive.org/web/20030730132927/http://michaelmoore.com/) won the Oscar award for Best Documentary. That made me happy.
