Yeah, I'm a bit of a news junkie, but mainly from theÂ [BBC](https://web.archive.org/web/20030730132927/http://news.bbc.co.uk/). That's probably due to some untreated Anglophilia that I really should address. Anyhow, I put together a nifty little [Perl](../../../card/Perl.md) CGI to make it easy for me to scan the latest news feeds from the BBC. Eventually, it'll be able to load every single [RSS](../../../card/RSS.md) feed that BBC makes available. Right now, it's just the World News headline.
