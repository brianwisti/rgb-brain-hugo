I got tired of having *no* pictures in the Image Gallery since the last site shuffle, so I finally decided to throw in a *scan of a knotwork picture.* That's the biggest change to the site, although there is a new page of links to information about [Raku](../../../card/Raku.md) . It will make it easier on me to keep that information in a single place, rather than rely on my memory.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a Harry Potter book to read.
