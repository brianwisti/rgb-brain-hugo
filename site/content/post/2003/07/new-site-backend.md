It's been a long time since I made a major site change. I would like to add a greater capacity for interactivity, so it's time to transform the static HTML into something else. How about PHP? Sounds good. I've got a fair approximation of the site's old functionality in place: the bread crumb trail works, and you have a useful navigation menu along the side. The side menu needs a few more steps before I'm really happy with it, but it basically works.

Hmm ... I better get a good 404 handler up or I'm going to get a lot of hate mail.

*Later that night:* I've been up late today. Since I really should be in bed, I had to do something to make myself feel better about it. So I made a math drill PHP script.
