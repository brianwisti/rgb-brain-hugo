title: 'Math: Factors Drill'

The second drill in the [Math section](https://web.archive.org/web/20030730132927/http://www.coolnamehere.com/math/) helps test your ability to do factoring, by asking you if one number is a factor of the other. I deliberately kept it simple - even so, I managed to start getting really lost around level three. These projects are going to build my math skill, if I don't watch it :-). You can test your [factoring skills](https://web.archive.org/web/20030730132927/http://www.coolnamehere.com/math/factor.php) for yourself, if you like.
