Trying to add Disqus comments once again. I adjusted permalinks, since the old `/:section/:year/:title/` structure seemed to confuse Disqus. Here’s hoping. I assigned aliases to content so that old links should work.

I know. I’m fickle about comments. I want them, then I don’t want them. I’d switch to WordPress but I’d have to untangle all the [Hugo](../../../card/Hugo.md) specifics that I’ve adopted over the last couple years.

Oh heck a week from now marks [two years](../../2015/09/next-hugo.md) since I switched to Hugo. Either it got easier to use or I got used to it. And every time I’m ready to look elsewhere they add something new.
