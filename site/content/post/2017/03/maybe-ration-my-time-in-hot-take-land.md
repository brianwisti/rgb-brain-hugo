I dunno, folks. Over the years I have seen so much [outrage](http://www.geekwire.com/2017/trump-supporters-voice-real-outrage-fake-resistanceradio-promoting-amazon-tv-series/) -- sincere or feigned -- on social media. Then there’s the [echo chamber](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/the-social-media-echo-chamber-is-real/) problem. Yeah. Nice thing about an RSS feed is that I’m guaranteed to see everything I subscribe to, but there’s no personal insult in unsubscribing.

I think maybe I could spend less time on Twitter and Facebook. Not give them up. They remain a source of great conversation. But this nonsense takes up brain that I just can’t spare. Some of my online friends cut themselves out completely, and [they like it](https://seeknuance.com/2017/03/07/im-happier-and-more-productive-without-twitter/). Perhaps I should follow their example. Besides, each of them that moves on means one less bit of signal in the noise.

There is so much noise.
