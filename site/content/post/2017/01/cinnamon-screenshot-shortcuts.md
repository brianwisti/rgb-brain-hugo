title: Cinnamon Screenshot Shortcuts

![attachments/img/2017/cover-2017-01-01.png](../../../attachments/img/2017/cover-2017-01-01.png)

I take many screenshots during my day, for work and for fun. I use the Cinnamon desktop environment in [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/). I kept forgetting the keyboard shortcuts to do screenshots directly rather than opening up [GNOME Screenshot](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en).

Here are the default shortcuts. You can customize them in Keyboard Settings, as shown in the image that started this post.

**Keyboard shortcuts for taking screenshots**

|Action|Shortcut|
|------|--------|
|Take a screenshot|`Print`|
|Take a screenshot of a window|`Alt + Print`|
|Take a screenshot of an area|`Shift + Print`|
|Copy area to clipboard|`Shift + Control + Print`|
|Copy screen to clipboard|`Control + Print`|
|Copy window to clipboard|`Control + Alt + Print`|
|Toggle recording desktop|`[Shift + Control + Alt + R`|

`Print` may have its own special label on your keyboard. On mine the Print key is labeled `PrtSc`.

Next, with pictures!

## Take A Screenshot

The `Print` key alone will save your entire screen.

## Take A Screenshot Of A Window

`Alt + Print` together to save a single window.

## Take A Screenshot Of An Area

`Shift + Print` for an area screenshot. Your mouse point will change to a crosshair. Click and drag to select the area you want to save.

Sometimes I had to hit this combo a few times to get it work. That could be a software bug somewhere or it could just be grit in my keyboard.

## Record Desktop

`Control + Shift + Alt + R` will start recording your desktop. The same combo will end the recording session. No sound is recorded. Recordings are saved as [WebM](http://www.webmproject.org/) files in your home directory. [WebM support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webm) is widespread, although some browsers require codecs to be installed.

For more advanced screen recording functionality, [RecordMyDesktop](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php) looks like a good bet.

Wanted to show you a video of the area screenshot functionality. The keyboard shortcut for that doesn’t seem to work when recording. Instead I made a video of using the screenshot application.

I tried several times before I noticed a little red light in the lower right corner when recording is active.

Since this is more to show about recording videos than anything else, I decided the full resolution video was not needed. I installed [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) and used it to resize the video, following the FFmpeg [resizing tutorial](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Scaling%20(resizing)%20with%20ffmpeg).

````
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
$ ffmpeg -i ~/cinnamon-20161231-9.webm -vf scale=720:-1 \
  static/video/2017/cinnamon-desktop-recording.webm
````

Ta-da!

Well — "ta-da" assuming your browser supports WebM.
