This is my version of the "Stripes (And Stripes) Forever Scarf" from [Stitch ’N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57512.Stitch_n_Bitch_Crochet). It came together quickly. The only real challenge was getting the first row of single chains in.

Someday I’ll stick exactly to a pattern. Today is not that day. Here are the things I intentionally changed.

* The pattern uses four colors, but I only had three I wanted to use for it
* I like longer scarves, so I added about six inches of length.
* I skipped the fringe. It did not move me.
