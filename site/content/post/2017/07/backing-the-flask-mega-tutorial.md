title: Backing The Flask Mega Tutorial Kickstarter
---

Miguel Grenberg's[Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) and [book](https://flaskbook.com/) helped me understand using Python’s [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Well, somewhat. My understanding would improve if I used it more. Haven’t taken advantage of the opportunity yet. Anyways - of course I decided to back his [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1124925856/the-new-and-improved-flask-mega-tutorial/) for updating the Flask Mega-Tutorial.

His [blog post about the Kickstarter](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-kickstarter) reminded me that he was doing this. I’m pushing it here because I know he creates great learning material. Oh and because I still feel a little bad about sending him so many questions during the "rough cuts" phase of the Flask book. Further endorsement: he was unfailingly polite and helpful responding to those questions.
