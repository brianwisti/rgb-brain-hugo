Last month I read an article about [duotone illustrations](https://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2012/08/duotone-illustrations.html) and decided to try
a version of the technique myself someday. Today was that day.

[Duotone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duotone) uses two colors — usually black and a color such as blue or red — to make an image. It was popular for a while in 20th Century illustration because it cost less than full color printing. Skilled duotone illustrators like [Mead Schaeffer](https://americanillustration.org/project/mead-schaeffer/) produced visually arresting images.

I wanted to manually create duotone images in sketch apps like Procreate. Time to describe what I came up with.

This post isn’t a tutorial, but the information may be useful to you. For that matter it may be useful to *me*. That’s really what this whole site is about, after all: making life easier for future me, and hopefully maybe you too.

I had a couple of self-imposed limitations while making this. I deliberately chose to only use flat color for this experiment — no shading to speak of. I also used a smaller canvas than usual. It wasn’t a technical limitation, but it did limit the detail I could put into the image.

In retrospect, that’s probably a good thing for this experiment. I ended up with about 50 layers the way I put things together, and this might have slowed my iPad down with a large image.

## Linework

The first finished step is a solid black and white image. It started out as a
knotwork panel demonstration, but somewhere along the way I decided the panel
needed extras. Most of those extras came from [Tangles of Kells](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26311641-the-tangles-of-kells).

## Values

Then I put the values in, working from a grayscale palette. Nothing fancy going on here. The background is darker, the foreground is lighter, with a couple small variations along the way.

I set the drop shadow layers to "Soft Light" so they wouldn’t obscure whatever was beneath them.

## Color

For color, I created a new layer under the value layers, which I set to "Multiply."

Here’s what that looked like, with everything else but linework cut out.

I had an initial stage where all the shadows were hatched lines. Duotone didn’t occur to me until near the end of linework. I’ll try value-based shading for everything in some future sketches.

In order to have value mix nicely with color, I put each color layer beneath its value layer and set the value layer’s mode to "Multiply."

## Final

And that’s how I ended up with this.

## What now?

That was fun.

I want to explore duotone more, trying some specific ideas.

* Shading instead of value blocks.
* Use higher contrasting values. This ended up just a tiny bit muddy to my eyes.
* Multiple color layers — tritone?
* Mixing grayscale values and color values in a style more similar to the  duotone illustrations I like so much.
