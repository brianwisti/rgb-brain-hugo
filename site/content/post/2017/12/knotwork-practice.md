This started with practicing a knotwork pattern from [Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/618205.Celtic_Art), and ended up as an exercise in how long I could add stuff before I got bored. Thirteen hours. Not bad.

Not in a row, of course.

Oh and I threw in a couple tangle elements from [The Tangles of Kells](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26311641-the-tangles-of-kells).

I might be ready to try drawing things on purpose again. Usually itâ€™s just that my hands get itchy when I see blank space.
