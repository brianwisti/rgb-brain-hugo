Took me less than a week. I like that. On the other hand, I established for certain that when I knit fast my gauge loosens up. The hat fits looser than it should. I like that less. On the *other* other hand, I already wear it most of the time. It feels nice.

This pattern came from [Son of Stitch ’n Bitch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170305.Son_of_Stitch_n_Bitch). I used [Patons Astra](http://www.yarnspirations.com/yarn/astra.html?super_attribute=YToxOntpOjQ1NjtzOjU6IjQ1NzA1Ijt9) black and — uh — some white yarn of about the right thickness.

This pattern works for beginners, or someone looking for a break from their big complicated projects. It might be easier if you knit in the round. There would be less purling, if nothing else. I may revisit this hat later knitting in the round, and either knit slower or use smaller needles.
