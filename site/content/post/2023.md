For me and many other tech folks the dominant background theme was [Job Search](../card/Job%20Search.md). For my posts, I attempted some form of normalcy.

Kind of hard to be normal with the collapse of Twitter and everybody talking about [Artificial Intelligence](../card/Artificial%20Intelligence.md), though. 

I also ended the [tumblelog](../card/tumblelog.md) project. I'd been neglecting it for a while. Some of the posts were good, though, so I pulled everything back into the main site.
