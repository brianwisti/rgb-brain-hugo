Thought I'd try the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io) on my [openSUSE](http://opensuse.org) Tumbleweed install.

RPMs and DEB files are available from the Atom site, and the RPM works just fine for me. There's the Markdown for [ruby-itunes-ratings-fun](../03/ruby-itunes-ratings-fun.md), a live preview, and some sort of Git integration showing up in the sidebar.

Since I'm more of a [Vim](../../../card/Vim.md) person, I don't really know what to do with Atom just yet. I may end up not doing much of anything with it. But at least I  now it works. Go ahead and try it out if you're curious.
