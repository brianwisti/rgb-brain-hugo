Blog post pending. But yeah. [`markdown-it-py`](https://markdown-it-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) preprocessing Markdown content for my [Hugo](../../../card/Hugo.md) site.

Why?

I don't understand the question. To find out if I can, I guess?

Working well enough that I added [another](../08/trying-a-thing-with-neovim.md) Neovim remote plugin to handle the task.
