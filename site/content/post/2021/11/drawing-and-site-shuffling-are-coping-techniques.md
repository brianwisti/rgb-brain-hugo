I do love the fairyfloss color scheme

That says it all, really. Been a stressful oh I don't know let's say year and a half or so.

Tweaked and reloaded the [Picnic CSS](https://picnicss.com/)-based theme I had a while back. I missed it. Buried my bookmarking links â€” they're still there for now, but I have another idea how I want to handle the "info dump" section of the site. I'll also revisit the Config section, since it still gets traffic even though I buried it months ago.

And then there's the drawing. More hours, days, and weeks of manual symmetry in [Linea Sketch](https://linea-app.com/). Got a store refresh planned for the art! That was what sparked the site shuffling. Wanted a clean slate for my money-grubbing.
