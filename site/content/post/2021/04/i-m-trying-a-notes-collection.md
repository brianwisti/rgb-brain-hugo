Using [card/Statamic](../../../card/Statamic.md) for the site this split second. Titles are mandatory in Statamic, but I'll figure something out. Could always treat "title" like a lead paragraph. That's the direction I was headed in with the Hugo site.

Course, I already changed my blueprint layout from the screenshot.
