title: yay fresh webmentions again
---

Finally reconnected the site flow bits that grab and file fresh [Webmentions](https://webmention.io). Probably going to tweak rendering of the [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) bits that feed reactions from bigger social networks. It's that or add threading *here* for conversation that happens *there*. No thank you.

Anyways yay!
