Okular document viewer with several tabs open including "Programming Crystal"

[Okular](https://okular.kde.org), the *inbox/KDE* document viewer, works on Windows. Not only that, but it's available in the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/okular/9n41msq1wnm8).

Free, obviously.

This should help keep annotations in order as I work through my TOREAD stack — three chapters down, only several hundred books to go —regardless of current operating system.
