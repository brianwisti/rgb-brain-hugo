title: oh no there is a shiny new SSG

Saw [Astro](../../../card/Astro.md) mentioned in my Twitter feed today. Tempting.

Been looking for a gateway SSG into JavaScript. Something with a little more built-in than [Eleventy](../../../card/Eleventy.md), but maybe a bit less than [Gatsby](../../../card/Gatsby.md). I think I'll play with Astro â€” see if it keeps my attention.

Will it keep my attention long enough to replace the Hugo version? Precedent says "no." But it should be fun just the same.
