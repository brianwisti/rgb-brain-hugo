I've been revisiting my [awesome](https://awesomewm.org) config, starting by refactoring the default `rc.lua`.  Was even thinking about making a post.

Then I remembered to look at [Epsi](http://epsi-rns.github.io)'s blog, which I already knew to be a great resource for Awesome.  And hey [Modularized Awesome WM Configuration Structure](http://epsi-rns.github.io/desktop/2016/07/06/modularized-awesome-structure.html) is the post I want to write, except better. Plenty of other great posts there too.
