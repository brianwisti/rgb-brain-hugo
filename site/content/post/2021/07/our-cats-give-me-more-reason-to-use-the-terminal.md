the cats help identify orphan nodes in an Obsidian.md vault graph

Trying to use the mouse? Play a video game? Look at your [Obsidian](../../../card/Obsidian.md) graph? Experiment with the [Logseq](../../../card/Logseq.md) `/draw` command? The cats are there to help.

Do I mind? Not a bit. Keeps me in the terminal. Helpful for focus. Though I sometimes wish they weren't  *quite* so helpful with the video games.

They're just doing their part!
