Got distracted by a note from [@choldgraf](https://twitter.com/choldgraf) about [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Markdown flavor aimed at technical writing, in a [Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/willmcgugan/status/1433735471323099139) that was not specifically about MyST.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two things you may be interested in:<br><br>Markdown in Sphinx : <a href="https://t.co/52Rj05JsqV">https://t.co/52Rj05JsqV</a><br><br>Automatically rebuild are load docs in sphinx: <a href="https://t.co/9lvFyCbB0W">https://t.co/9lvFyCbB0W</a><br><br>Pydata theme: <a href="https://t.co/9qXss5cN15">https://t.co/9qXss5cN15</a><br><br>Lots of other nice themes here: <a href="https://t.co/27G9oawNVu">https://t.co/27G9oawNVu</a></p>&mdash; Chris Holdgraf (@choldgraf) <a href="https://twitter.com/choldgraf/status/1433802076438482949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This distracted me from the [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) blog idea that was distracting me from a [Nikola](../../../card/Nikola.md) blog idea that was distracting me from an attempt at porting my site to [Astro](../../../card/Astro.md) that was distracting me from a [Nanoc](../../../card/Nanoc.md)-in-Python project idea that was distracting me from preparing a client site proposal that was distracting me from Labor Day weekend prep that was distracting me from the work chat that was distracting me from work.

I had a question about using MyST for blogging, but decided to look it up for myself. Then I was going to tweet it but got distracted by the thought that I needed more persistent record what with all the distraction.

The question I almost tweeted:

 > 
 > Are there plugins or tools for using MyST to author blog posts?

My answer:

 > 
 > Why yes there are! A quick search found these, and there are doubtless
 > other resources.
 > 
 > * [markdown-it-myst](https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-myst) for the `.js` blogs
 > * A [myst Nikola plugin](https://plugins.getnikola.com/v8/myst/) for the `.py` blogs

Could probably even use it in [Hugo](../../../card/Hugo.md) if I make another [neovim plugin](../08/trying-a-thing-with-neovim.md) for `.md.txt` files.

Anyways, time to refill the coffee and — flips past the Distraction Cards — work! Oh jeez yeah work.
