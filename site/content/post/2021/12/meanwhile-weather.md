hey we got some snow

Would you look at that? We got some actual weather.

What else?

Been keeping myself busy with the JavaScript static site generators. Last week's [Astro](../../../card/Astro.md) experiment got slow so I've been messing with [Eleventy](../../../card/Eleventy.md).

Probably my last note of the year, so: Happy New Year!
