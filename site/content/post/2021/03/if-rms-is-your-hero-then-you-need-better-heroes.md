Yeah this is about Stallman being back on the board of the FSF. Kev Quirk has good [thoughts](https://kevq.uk/my-thoughts-on-richard-stallmans-return-to-the-fsf-board/) about how it was communicated. Me, I'm tired. I had *just* been thinking how some of my favorite people have been driven off the public Internet via doxxing and harassment.

And now Free Software's problematic fave — one of many, to be honest — is back, without so much as a hint of personal responsibility. Bah.

I'm not purging my system or anything, but I'm sure as hell done making a point of using GNU tools. This affects the FSF not one bit. It's only me conserving my energy for things I can care about.
