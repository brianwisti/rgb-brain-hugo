I don't even know how many hours I spent on this.  An hour or two a night — but not every night — since November or so?

I like it, however long I spent drawing the dang thing.

[Linea](https://linea-app.com/) takes a very constrained approach to tools.  No automatic symmetry.  No blend modes.  Only five layers.  Makes it feel like a paper sketch book, but with bonuses.  Their approach to color palettes is one of those bonuses.  I used their predefined "Art Deco" palette for this.
