Goodness I may dislike that templating language, but it's hard to match anything against [card/Hugo](../../../card/Hugo.md)'s 700ms average build time on a cleaned-up version of my site.

But I'm having fun with the JavaScript too. Maybe I'll mash them both together by using [Site.js](https://sitejs.org), which supports Hugo under the hood for fancier static sites.
