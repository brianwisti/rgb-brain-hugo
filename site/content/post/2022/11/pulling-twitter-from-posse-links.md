title: Pulling Twitter From POSSE Links

Lots of Elon Musk madness going on at Twitter. From a [Platformer summary](https://www.platformer.news/p/inside-the-twitter-meltdown) of the last day or two.

This is on top of all the folks Musk fired or who have resigned in the week since he took over. Encouraging folks to use Twitter seems unwise at this point.

Nothing profound here. Just means I'm not explicitly syndicating to or tracking WebMentions from there.
