I'm gonna fill this space with the contents of a tweet thread describing my adventures importing [Taskwarrior](../../../card/Taskwarrior.md) tasks into [Logseq](../../../card/Logseq.md).

<!--more-->

Course, it started as a toot thread. But I don't have a shortcode handy for embedding those. You get a link:

Right, I started with Obsidian. Then I thought about how Logseq has task management features built-in. Decided to shift focus there.

Took me a bit to figure out how I wanted to link everything up. Ended up with a more cohesive graph --- to my eyes, at least.

The secondary purpose was to get more comfortable using [TypeScript](../../../card/TypeScript.md) and [Node.js](../../../card/Node.js.md). I didn't revert to Python, Perl, or Ruby for *any* of this. Mission accomplished!

You want to *see* the code? Ah. Well. Maybe later. This was flailing and puttering code, not showing off code.

````bash
task add project:Site +blog \
  write better on taskwarrior logseq import
````

There. Now it can haunt me for the next couple years.
