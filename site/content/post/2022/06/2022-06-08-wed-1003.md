Started playing with local `custom.css` to tweak the [Panic](https://github.com/sokirill/logseq-panic-theme) theme for [card/Logseq](../../../card/Logseq.md).

Some of those jots go back to Logseq 0.1.x, so don't trust them.

I changed the default text font to [OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org) and code to the [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) version of [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans). No I'm not dyslexic --- at least I'm pretty sure I'm not â€” but I find these friendlier and easier to read than the more severe fonts in common use. I usually install them locally on whatever device I use for ready access.

````css
:root {
  --ls-font-family: "OpenDyslexic";
  --ls-page-text-size: 18px;
}

.extensions__code .CodeMirror {
  font-family: "FantasqueSansMono NF", monospace;
}

.content :not(pre) > code {
    font-family: "FantasqueSansMono NF", monospace;
}
````

Now I want to go all in and make a proper theme.
