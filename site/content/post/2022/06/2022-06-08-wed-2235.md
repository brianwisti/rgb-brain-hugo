Having put about 150 hours combined into American / European [Truck Simulator](https://worldoftrucks.com/en/profile/6779015) — for me, a very long time paying attention to the same topic — this review by [Yahtzee](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/category/zero-punctuation/) describing [Hardspace: Shipbreaker](https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/hardspace-shipbreaker) as a "Dad game" makes it sound possibly relevant to my interests.
