Figured out how to do [text snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) in [VS Code](../../../card/VS%20Code.md) for [Dendron](../../../card/Dendron.md) notes. My wish for this world is less JSON.

Would YAML be better? Maybe, but no. I'm thinking something more like Emacs [yasnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet) files. Sure a file for every snippet may sound like overkill. It's a heck of a lot easier to figure out what a single template looks without filtering from JSON list and then translating from JSON string to template string.

Anyways, snippets for timestamped list items in Dendron.

````json
{
    "itime": {
        "prefix": "itime",
        "scope": "markdown",
        "body": "- **$CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:** ",
        "description": "timestamp for interstitial notes"
    },
    "inow": {
        "prefix": "inow",
        "scope": "markdown",
        "body": "- **$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE $CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:** ",
        "description": "datetime for interstitial notes"
    }
}
````

Handy for [interstitial journaling](https://betterhumans.pub/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef). Take the claims about interstitial journaling with as much salt as you need. I use timestamped notes to remember when I did, said, or thought a thing.

For some of us "time tracking" is just a tool to — um — track time.
