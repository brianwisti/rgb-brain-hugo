We got [married](../../2020/03/got-married-yesterday.md) in March of 2020. Finally getting our Hawai'i honeymoon in December of 2022. But of course I need a few minutes here and there to putter.

Looking up [how](https://indieweb.org/ActivityPub) IndieWeb folks work with ActivityPub â€” the standard used by Mastodon and other [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party) applications to communicate.

But honestly I'm just taking pics of her and enjoying the sun.
