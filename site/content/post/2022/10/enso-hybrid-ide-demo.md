title: Enso Hybrid IDE Demo
---

[Enso](https://enso.org) is "a hybrid visual and textual functional language." So far, the demo is cooler than the alpha. Because so far I have not yet gotten the alpha [nightly release](https://github.com/enso-org/enso/releases) to work.

But good lord that is a cool demo.

Enthusiastic, too.
