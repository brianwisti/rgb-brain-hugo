Continuing to get annoyed at Datalog for [queries](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/advanced%20queries) in Logseq, when I remembered [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com) uses a SQLite database. Plus there's [org-roam-ui](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui), which â€” sheesh. It's impressive.

I have way too much sitting in my Logseq graph to just bounce, but it's good to
remember I have options.
