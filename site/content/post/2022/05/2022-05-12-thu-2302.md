Promised I'd go to bed before 11pm. Oops. Okay but just getting this link to [Tide](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide) --- *TypeScript Interactive Development Environment* for Emacs --- before I go brush my teeth.

Also? I need to fiddle with my capture template logic for these notes, so it exports the subtree when I file from wherever.
