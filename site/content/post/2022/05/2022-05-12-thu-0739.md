Last night I ran a clean install of [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com) 22.04 on the Linux partition. All seemed well, until I noticed that no Electron-based apps had titlebars. Also? Unless I'm in tiling mode, they're all stacked in one unreachable, unresizable mass in the middle.

No screenshot, sorry. Had to get stuff done so I'm regrouping in the Windows partition. I'll ponder what to do about it later. Might overlay the whole thing with [Regolith Desktop](http://regolith-desktop.com) until I get a better plan. Regretting that I replaced a perfectly functional [Regolith 1.6](https://regolith-linux.org) install for this.
