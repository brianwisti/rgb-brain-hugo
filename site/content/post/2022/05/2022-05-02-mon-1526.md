So what's the plan?

* use Org mode for authoring and organizing on my side of things
* take advantage of [Netlify](https://netlify.com) features where possible
* loads of [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) of course

ox-hugo and Hugo were the easiest to start with on this idea, but I may end up somewhere else. [Elder.js](https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/) and [Orga](https://orga.js.org) could lead me down another path, for example.
