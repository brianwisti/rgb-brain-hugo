Tuning my [card/Org](../../../card/Org.md) tumblelogging setup for *this* site but of course since I'm using a [Literate Config](https://zzamboni.org/book/lit-config/) approach and generally [publishing](https://randomgeekery.org/config/emacs) that stuff once updated I am of course reworking my `config.org` because I wasn't happy with how a code block was being exported.
