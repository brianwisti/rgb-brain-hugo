My only *intentional* use of Emacs at the moment is assorted [Org mode](https://orgmode.org) tools, but even at that level it'd sure help to get more comfortable with it.

Got myself a copy of [Mastering Emacs](https://masteringemacs.org) to fill in a few of the gaps between `C-h t` and wherever I've been at for the last few years.
