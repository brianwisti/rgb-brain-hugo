New Windows Terminal Preview [release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-preview-1-14-release/) dropped. I spend enough time working in Windows that I pay attention to this stuff.

<!--more-->

I'm fussy about my terminal experience, so I use [Windows Terminal Preview](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal-preview/9N8G5RFZ9XK3?hl=en-us&gl=US) when getting work done on Windows. It's a few steps ahead of the main release, which currently means fewer — not *none* but fewer — weird little display bugs in Neovim and tmux.

You'll probably mostly see screenshots of the multi-pane single-image background, but I don't mess with image backgrounds in my terminal. Too distracting for my brain.

This bit about GUI apps interests me though. It might smooth things out when I'm running X11 Emacs from WSL2.

Oh hey what's this?

Bumped into this bug the other day, while cleaning out some neglected distro installations.
