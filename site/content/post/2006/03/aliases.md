Here's my [TIL](../../../card/TIL.md) for [Ruby](../../../card/Ruby.md). When you override a method in a subclass, you also need to redeclare any aliases for that method. Seems pretty obvious when you think about it. I didn't think about it, though, and it caught me up for a few minutes.

I'd post a block of sample code, but I keep getting `"body, Malformed HTML found."`
errors from [43 Things](../../../card/43%20Things.md) whenever I try to save with my code in there (`pre` tags and
all)
