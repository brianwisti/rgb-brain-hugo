title: There Must Be Something Wrong With Me
---

There must be something wrong with me. I've been sitting here for the last hour, merrily watching Jigdo downloading components for a [Debian](http://www.debian.org) ISO. This is roughly equivalent to watching paint dry, except for the fact that at least the latter provides you with a dry painted surface when it's done.

Like I said, there must be something wrong with me.
