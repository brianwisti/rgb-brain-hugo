Another one of those "no I’m not dead" posts. Instead of writing I’ve been *Drawing* quite a bit this year. The writing will resume. For now, enjoy a sample of my favorite sketches from the last several months.

Meanwhile, I’m also getting my site to work with [IndieWeb](../../../card/IndieWeb.md). I’m not entirely sure what that means yet, but the claim of improving quality of connection between author-owned Web content appeals to me. I love better organization and the possibility of better connection for my stuff, so I’ve followed the steps at [IndieWebify.Me](https://indiewebify.me/) partway through level 2. Just need to understand *Webmention*.
