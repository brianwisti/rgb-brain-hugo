By special request, some fingerless gloves using a bit of every sock yarn I own.

When I offered to make a pair, my friend pointed out a pair she had seen on Etsy. I started from a straightforward pattern in Sally Melville's [The Knitting Experience Book 2: The Purl Stitch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24691.The_Knitting_Experience).

Yes I'll try to find that pair on Etsy again at some point, because it's a great design and people should buy that designer's stuff.
