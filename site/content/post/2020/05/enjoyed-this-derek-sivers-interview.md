I'm not a money podcast person, but this episode was worth an hour of my time.
I found myself nodding along with this interview with [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) â€” who I already love for [now](../../../page/now.md) pages and the [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/) project. His emphasis on making enough vs making all the billions meshes well with my preference for using the tech you need vs emulating Google-scale solutions for *every* project.

I also enjoyed the shout-out to [Amy Hoy](https://stackingthebricks.com/).

No transcript, so I'll just quote the summary:

 > 
 > In this episode, you'll learn:
 > 
 > * The difference between living a highly focused life vs making time to ponder and think.
 > * Interesting thoughts on money, wealth, and defining what's enough.
 > * Great book recommendations on the topic of money.
