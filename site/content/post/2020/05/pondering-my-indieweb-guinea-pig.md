Can't throw the YAPC::NA shirt away yet. Hasn't worn through completely

<a class="u-category h-card" href="https://jmac.org">Jason McIntosh</a> seems like a reasonable choice to test [Webmention](../../../card/Webmention.md) on. I wouldn’t know about the [IndieWeb](../../../card/IndieWeb.md) if not for him. I know I’ll try his [Web::Mention](https://metacpan.org/pod/Web::Mention) library eventually. But first, [webmention-tools](https://github.com/Ryuno-Ki/webmention-tools).

The other stuff didn’t work and didn’t give useful errors. I ended up using Web::Mention. It’s fine. Just half to rewrite half the post. That’s fine.
