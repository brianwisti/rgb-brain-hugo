Where's the rest of the post?

Got a [Pyinvoke](../../../card/Pyinvoke.md) `test` task for the site. Because of that, I found a post about [Jekyll collections](../../2015/07/making-a-jekyll-collection.md) that got truncated â€” before the current repo existed.

Fixed it though. Got the missing content from an [old copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160318224730/http://randomgeekery.org/post/2015/making-a-jekyll-collection). Yay for Internet Archive!
