[micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) â€” apparently it's like `nano` but bigger.

OMG I hit `C-v` and it pasted the link. Just like that. Then I dragged that [filemanager](https://github.com/NicolaiSoeborg/filemanager-plugin) divider over with my *mouse* and it worked.

A shell text editor? With key bindings that make sense to people who haven't had their brains warped by Unix? With window splitting and tabs and JSON configuration and Lua plugins? I'm so confused.
