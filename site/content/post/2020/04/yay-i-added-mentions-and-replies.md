Not real time, of course. It updates when I build the site. The layout needs touching up. But all the details are there.

Webmentions for [my wedding post](../03/got-married-yesterday.md)

I used Max Böck’s [Webmentions post](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/#webmentions) as a starting point.

And yes, I’m far enough along with the [card/IndieWeb](../../../card/IndieWeb.md) stuff that my study notes would make a decent blog post. Maybe a couple.
