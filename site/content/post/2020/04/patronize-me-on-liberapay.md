Been skimming through [ethical.net](https://ethical.net) resources recently. [Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/) looks interesting: a patronage system like Patreon, but without reward tiers. More of a "keep doing — whatever the hell it is that you’re doing — it’s great" approach. So I [joined](https://en.liberapay.com/randomgeek/) of course. Give me money and I’ll keep doing exactly what I’ve been doing. Such a deal!
