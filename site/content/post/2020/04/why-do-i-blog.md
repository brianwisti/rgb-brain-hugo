searched my image library for "why" and got this old doodle

I usually answer *Why are you like that* questions — which I get asked with some frequency, for good or ill — with "I can’t help it. It’s in my nature." The constant puttering, interspersed with oversharing that ranges from instructive to awkward? That’s just me. I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t do that.

But this came across my RSS feed, and it works too.

That’s true too. There are ways to putter and rant besides blogging. I could have a YouTube channel. But this is what I know how to do.

Thank goodness.
