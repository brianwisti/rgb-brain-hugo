Myk Bolkonstky's [Things Every Software Engineer Should Know About Neurodiversity](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-things-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-neurodiversity):

Neurodiversity provides an alternate take on traits that are common to [ADHD](../../../card/ADHD.md), autism, OCD, and others. Myk’s talk summarizes them better than I could, and better than resources I could find for linking.

The talk lasts half an hour including questions. Some occasional audio issues thanks to everyone’s new remote life, but the transcript makes following easier.

Some new / clarified bits for me — aside from the above quote:

* many folks experience these traits, but their intensity for neurodivergent folks is such that we must plan our lives around them
* useful medical information is not widely available
* "dead time" oh god that thing where your brain won’t let you do something now because you’re planning to do something later
* description of "autistic burnout" sounds like something I’m going through right now
