**Kev Quirk on static site generators** — [WordPress Creator Vs The Jamstack](https://kevq.uk/wordpress-creator-vs-the-jamstack/) (2020-05-20)

I often see "such and such [card/Static Site Generator](../../../card/Static%20Site%20Generator.md) is simple!" tweets, and wonder what exactly they're comparing it to. DIY dentistry perhaps?

As much as I love puttering with static site generators, "puttering" is the main charm of an SSG. The hooks to customize are right there on the surface. Heck [Eleventy](../../../card/Eleventy.md) is nothing *but* hooks. And having everything in a git repository is just a developer-focused version of a smart backup plan.

For the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) side of things, I'm not sure I see the advantage of relying on a load of external services over oh say for example having a database and an internal comment system. You know, like Wordpress. Something I've been thinking about a lot in relation to my own site leaning so much on [webmention.io](https://webmention.io/).
