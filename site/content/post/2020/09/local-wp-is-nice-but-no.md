Playing with an instance of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) on my computer by way of [Local](https://localwp.com/) and I'm at a loss. What's that big friendly-looking thing with the unobtrusive buttons? Where are the 150 things I need to remember for a single post?

Well, they're probably in the part where I'd need to make sure everything is up to date. With the static site once it's up I don't have to care about it any more.

My brain hurts.

I felt like [Fezzik](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/characters/nm0000764).

Only â€” you know. Smaller. Not so intimidating.

Nah, I'll stick with my overcomplicated site workflow for now.
