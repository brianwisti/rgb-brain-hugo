Woke up with the terrible idea of rewriting [WebMake](http://webmake.taint.org/) as a [card/Gatsby](../../../card/Gatsby.md) plugin but:

* I don’t even know who would know what I’m talking about
* I don’t know how to do that
* [I’m just not sure how well this plan was thought through](https://youtu.be/93B072j-E3I).
