Making note of this [tweet](https://twitter.com/eleven_ty/status/1214681563507699713) for later:

I love that there are so many great static site generators out. I hate that I don’t have enough time to try *all* of them.

But [card/Eleventy](../../../card/Eleventy.md) has the possum logo. Hard to argue with that. Maybe I’ll revisit with the [base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) template, or one of the other [starter kits](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/). The [deep dive](../../2019/04/eleventy.md) idea was a little ambitious, anyways.
