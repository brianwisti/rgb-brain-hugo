I enjoyed a recent post on [picking a static site generator in 2020](https://snipcart.com/blog/choose-best-static-site-generator). Along with explaining the *what* and *why* of SSGs, the post lists a few favorites. [card/Gatsby](../../../card/Gatsby.md), [card/Hugo](../../../card/Hugo.md), [Eleventy](../../../card/Eleventy.md), and even the now-venerable [card/Jekyll](../../../card/Jekyll.md) get highlighted. So do a few that are still new to me, like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/). I’ll probably try those too at some point.

Nothing about [card/Nikola](../../../card/Nikola.md). Too bad! It’s a blast to tinker with.

My suggestion? If you have a business need, follow *that*. But if you want to have fun? Try them all! Write code to carry posts forward from one generator to the next!

And try making your own sometime. That’s fun too!

Okay, I admit it. I have weird ideas of fun.
