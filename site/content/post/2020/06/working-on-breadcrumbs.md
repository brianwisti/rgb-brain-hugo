once again, the pic is irrelevant but Jumpy Dog sure is cute

Starting a new job on Monday, which is pretty exciting. Also, figured out a whole bunch of breadcrumb and timeline stuff for the site, starting from a [shortcode example](https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/#example-breadcrumb-navigation) I never noticed in the [card/Hugo](../../../card/Hugo.md) documents before.

Hoping I finish before I get all distracted on Monday.
