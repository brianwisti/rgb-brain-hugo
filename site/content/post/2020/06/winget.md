[winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) is a command line package manager for *inbox/Windows* 10, open-sourced under the [MIT License](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/blob/master/LICENSE).  Roughly equivalent to `apt` or `brew`.  If you already know and love [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), you’re fine.  Stick with that for now. `winget` shows promise though.

The other night I installed [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com) and played with [Image::ExifTool](https://metacpan.org/release/Image-ExifTool) a tiny bit.

Yesterday I successfully installed Emacs and started doing real work writing Perl code with it.

Exciting!

Well, not *work* work. The new job doesn’t start until tomorrow, and is mostly Python.

## How do I get Winget?

`winget` is still in preview.  You can get it as part of the [Windows Insider](https://insider.windows.com/) program, like me.  Slow Ring should be fine.  If you don’t feel like taking the risk on a preview release of Windows, you can grab it from the [winget-cli repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).

## Finding and installing stuff with `winget`

One goal when in Windows is to *use* Windows, and not just spend all day hiding
in WSL.  If I want to use Windows, I need [card/Perl](../../../card/Perl.md).

Hey, I’ll allow myself a few crutches here and there.

Ooh, [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).  I haven't messed with that in years.

But no I'm just here for Perl today.  Strawberry Perl is an excellent Perl setup for Windows.  Provides all the core stuff, a bunch of [useful extras](http://strawberryperl.com/release-notes/5.30.2.1-64bit.html), and the tools you need to install additional libraries.

`winget show` displays additional details about a package.

Yep, that's what I want.

Things do get automatically added to your path, but not right away.  Somebody more familiar with Windows probably knows what to do.  Me?  When it doesn't catch right away I log out and back in.  That always does the trick.

Now what about all the other package manger functionality?

## What about updating, listing, uninstalling, etc?

Um.  Well.  I mentioned `winget` is in preview, right?  Check the development [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/blob/master/doc/windows-package-manager-v1-roadmap.md).
