plumbing place worryingly close to a power outlet

## Jots

Kind of random selection this week, but that's on brand. I played with therapeutic noise generation, read up on lesser AI apocalypses like model collapse and investors finally getting picky, and learned some Git.

Then the kitchen faucet started leaking into the storage space with all the cleaning supplies and for some reason known only to our landlords, a power outlet. Fixed the problem with ~~Perl~~ a wrench, but that kept me occupied enough that I nearly forgot what day it was.

Hi!
