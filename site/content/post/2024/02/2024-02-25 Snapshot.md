## Jots

We went to a kickboxing class this week! That was fun.

Other than that, applying for jobs, setting up interviews, poking at [Ruby](../../../card/Ruby.md) and [Crystal](../../../card/Crystal.md) for some utility scripts, and trying little experiments to see if any other [PKM](../../../card/PKM.md) might work as well or better than what I've got going on with [Obsidian](../../../card/Obsidian.md). I do most daily capturing in [Logseq](../../../card/Logseq.md), but so far my strict namespace requirements are a little more challenging without help from plugins.
