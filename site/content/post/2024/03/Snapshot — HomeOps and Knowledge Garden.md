# Snapshot — HomeOps and Knowledge Garden

Staying pretty good with the weekly rhythm, but getting tired of seeing "YYYY-MM-DD Snapshot" in the recent posts

## Jots

### HomeOps

Helped *MrsGeek* put together a single-page "link in bio" site like one might see on Linktree and elsewhere. Seemed silly for her to pay a subscription price for something when she's already got tech support right here.

I settled on [Eleventy](../../../card/Eleventy.md) because I like it, with [Tailwind CSS](../../../card/Tailwind%20CSS.md) for a little resume-driven development. [marcamos/jet](https://github.com/marcamos/jet) provided the starting point. I shuffled a few pieces for long-term project structure. Hosted on Netlify because it's way easier than thinking.

We're definitely going with an iterative approach, but iteration one is already live at [https://deejwi.me](https://deejwi.me/)

### Knowledge Garden

![initial version of this post in Logseq](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240303211110.png)
Been doing all of my capturing in [Logseq](../../../card/Logseq.md), and more of my processing lately too. I still work most easily with outlines, even for structured longform writing. So of course I'll see how it would work as the source for [My Public Brain](../../../card/My%20Public%20Brain.md). The hard part is getting it out there in a structure that I like. Might be time to revisit [logseqs-export-formats](../../2022/03/logseqs-export-formats.md). Meanwhile the published notes continue to use [Obsidian](../../../card/Obsidian.md) for the foreseeable future.

## Plan

[Job Search](../../../card/Job%20Search.md) continues for me and a lot of other people. Got a second interview coming up that I'm pretty excited about.
