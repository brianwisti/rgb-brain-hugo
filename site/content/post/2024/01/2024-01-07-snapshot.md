Output of a ComfyUI Stable Diffusion experiment

Shared notes. Not too much. Mostly links.

I want to call them "weekly notes." I lack confidence in my time awareness, so let's go with "snapshot." But hey. I fill up my notes every day. Why not share some of the interesting items here from time to time?

[All Things Considered - The Mark Kistler Interview - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP4cSfrJUuE)
: Been a fan of Mark Kistler since before I was a fan of computers. I've shared one Kistler-inspired work — [post/2020/04/kistler-tree](../../2020/04/kistler-tree.md) — and have multiple sketchbooks full of similar. Of course I listened to this interview.

[Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager. - Build Excellent Websites](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/)
: Exposed to *Build Excellent Websites* thanks to the [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) starter. Good guidelines and good tools for Web design.

[Free Pascal - Advanced open source Pascal compiler for Pascal and Object Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/)
: Niklaus Wirth died this week. The Pascal programming language was only one of his contributions, but it's the one I kind of know.

[Beginner's Guide to ComfyUI - Stable Diffusion Art](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/comfyui/)
: A workflow-based GUI for [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionxl.com) as I learn the different technologies under the buzzword blanket of *\*Artificial Intelligence\**.

[ebullient/markdown-it-obsidian-callouts: Markdown extensions for obsidian](https://github.com/ebullient/markdown-it-obsidian-callouts)
: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) has some fairly specific syntax for callouts. This extension could help with that for publishing a second brain with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). Now I just need to switch to Eleventy. And stick with Obsidian.

[Hackers.town Noto Peninsula Earthquake Relief Custom Ink Fundraising](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/hackerstown-noto-peninsula-earthquake-relief-1747)
: Cool T-shirts for good causes, by the good folks at [Hackers.town](https://hackers.town), my preferred Fediverse instance.

[2023 Word of the Year is “enshittification” – American Dialect Society](https://americandialect.org/2023-word-of-the-year-is-enshittification/)
: Because honestly what other word could describe 2023 so well? [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net) came up with it, and used it to great effect when [describing TikTok and others](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/).
