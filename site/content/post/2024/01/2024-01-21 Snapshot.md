Mostly working on the brain-blog hybrid.

## Jots

* Almost done with my brain-blog hybrid project, merging [My Public Brain](../../../card/My%20Public%20Brain.md) with [Random Geekery](../../../card/Random%20Geekery.md).
* Made some forward progress on the current [Job Search](../../../card/Job%20Search.md). Nothing concrete yet, but people want to talk to me. That feels nice.

## Plan

* shift the live site from blog to brain-blog
* ever forward with job search

## Bookmarks

A fair bit of [Obsidian](../../../card/Obsidian.md) stuff got my attention this week as I worked out ways to publish the vault within my own very particular workflow. BTW I'd just use Obsidian Publish if I wasn't me.

[rehype-obsidian-callout - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-obsidian-callout)
: support callouts (notes, warnings, etc) in remark-based SSGs

[remark-obsidian - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-obsidian)
: converts most of Obsidian's markup, though right now it strips out path information when slugifying links (`/card/ADHD` becomes `/cardadhd`)

[GitHub - zoni/obsidian-export: Rust library and CLI to export an Obsidian vault to regular Markdown](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export)
: handy for exporting Obsidian vaults; does not yet handle callouts or YouTube embeds; I ended up settling on [obsidian-export](../../../card/obsidian-export.md) + some post-processing for my current publishing workflow

[Can You See The Red Flags Of A Toxic Tech Company? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNbWmjGNZD8)
: this will always be relevant; some good general indicators, but the vaguest-sounding one to "trust your gut" is the one I've regretted ignoring over the years
