I have been spending most of my free time working on aÂ [Rails project](https://github.com/brianwisti/marysplace-rails) for the [Mary's Place](http://www.marysplaceseattle.org/) day shelter. At some point - probably after many scan/edit cycles with [metric_fu](https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu) -- it occurred to me that even though my Rails knowledge has increased over the last year, my core [card/Ruby](../../../card/Ruby.md) skills have not. They have stayed static. They may even have deteriorated a bit, since Rails does so much work for the developer.

This seems like a perfect opportunity to reread the Pickaxe book [Programming Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0). This might not count as a reread, though. I have not read it cover to cover since the second edition came out. They are on to the fourth edition now.
