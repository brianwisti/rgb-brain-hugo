There's still a *lot* of tweaking that I want to do, but I found Ron Grafe's [Bottom-Slide Info Box](https://web.archive.org/web/20020331121224/http://www.lonestar.texas.net/~rgrafe/Pages/Scripts/BottomSlider/bottomslider.htm). I works nicely under both NS 4.x and Mozilla, so hopefully it won't break anyone's browser out there. Still ugly as sin, though. Gotta fix that.

Oh yeah ... to see it in action, just let your mouse rest on one of the links in the main menu at the top of the page.
