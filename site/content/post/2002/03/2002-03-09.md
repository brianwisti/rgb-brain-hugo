There's a problem about being a Linux geek. When something breaks under Windows, you're just as lost as the Windows guru would be under Redhat. Kinda sad, really. Had DSL problems which I still haven't sorted out under Windows, but took me 5 minutes to fix in Linux. This machine is back to being dual-boot for the moment, until I can afford an extra box.

Part two of the Python tutorial is past the halfway point, but I am going to take a brain break while I explore what's new in [Zope](https://web.archive.org/web/20020327165259/http://www.zope.org/) 2.5. Meanwhile, does anybody know about a really awesome vector illustration program for Linux / Unix?
