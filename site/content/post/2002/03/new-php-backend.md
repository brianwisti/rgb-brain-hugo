Technical decision here. I had to think about the CPU cycles on this old machine, and yer basic  [PHP](../../../card/PHP.md) + [mySQL](https://web.archive.org/web/20020331121224/http://www.mysql.com/) solution works pretty fast, and sucks up a bit less memory than [Zope](https://web.archive.org/web/20020331121224/http://www.zope.org/).
