I'm having *too* much fun with Zope these days. In particular, I've come across the wonderful Python IDE [Boa Constructor](https://web.archive.org/web/20020327165259/http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/). It is still alpha quality *(which roughly means you should be surprised if it works right every time)*, but this is the best free tool for Python development. It even has some nifty features for working with your Zope pages! If you're feeling bold, I highly recommend you try it out.

I'm also finally working on part 2 of my Python tutorial, and I'd like to have that live by the end of the week.

Sorta figuring out Danny Yoo's [Code Colorizer](https://web.archive.org/web/20020327165259/http://www.decrem.com:8080/ChalkBoard/1014872993/index_html). It's a neat little package that produces colorized HTML markup out of your python code. *Very* handy to have in a Python tutorial. Danny mostly has it working for his [Python Chalkboard](https://web.archive.org/web/20020327165259/http://www.decrem.com:8080/ChalkBoard/), and was kind enough to dish up his current code - today, right after he was asked. Many thanks to him!
