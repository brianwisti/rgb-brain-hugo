Wow, that was a long hiatus. For budget reasons, COOLNAMEHERE was down for the last month. I've scraped some change together, though, and the site is now being hosted by SWHU. Feels strange not hosting the site from my home machine. Then again, it's nice to be able to shut down my computer every once in a while :-).

So, now I have the Adobe Web Collection. It was money well spent! Time to make some pretty pictures.
