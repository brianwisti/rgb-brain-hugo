Hm. The [local library](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://www.spl.org/)Â is holding a copy of Adobe GoLive Classroom in a Book. I should really go down there and pick it up, since I am just sitting here and staring at the monitor otherwise.

Well, I have been fiddling around a little bit tonight. My host supports PHP, and I've been trying to think of a decent project for it. Give me a few days.
