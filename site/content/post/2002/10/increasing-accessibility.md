title: Increasing Accessibility
date: 2002-10-18

While I'm figuring out whether or not to use some fancy PHP Content Management System, I figured I might as well do a quick check of the site to see how accessible it is. Accessibility basically boils down to "Can *everybody* who visits your site get to the content?" That includes people with disabilities such as blindness. Cascading Style Sheets go a long way towards increasing site accessibility, but there are a few good habits that I'd missed. Due to my intensely fragile ego, it's important to me that everyone can see my contributions to the Web. If you are concerned about accessibility, you might want to put [Bobby](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://bobby.watchfire.com/bobby/html/en/index.jsp) to use. It will go over a URL and tell you what basic guidelines your site is missing. And that's why there are one or two minor tweaks to the site.

This is the largest news item I've put on the site in ages, and I just realized that it's main purpose is to explain why the site menu uses hyphens now. It must be one of those days.
