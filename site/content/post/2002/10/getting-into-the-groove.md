Thanks to Craig Wisti of [Globalhonk](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://www.globalhonk.com/), coolnamehere is alive and healthy. I had some serious problems with the Web host SWHU, now I'm using [Spidersaid](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://spidersaid.com/), and things are much smoother. Thanks, Dad *=-)*

Oh, and I'm looking at breaking everything by getting postNuke installed as the CMS for the site.
