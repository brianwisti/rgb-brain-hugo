It's been an organizing week more than anything else for me. I decided to apply the magic of `make` to the site building process, which automates creation and installation of site files. Either that, or I'm about to wipe out the entire site. Let's hope not!

I spent a few hours arranging and adding captions to some of the galleries in the photo album. Not every gallery has comments, because I ran out of ideas after a while. There are a few, though.

There's a link to [my brother's site](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://wisti73.tripod.com/) on the exit page now. I enjoy mentioning family online.

Once again there are no new drawings. I've been busy with a lot of different things, but I'm running out of excuses now. I best get some new drawings done. Meanwhile, you can peek through history to see a few older drawings that I've scanned and put into the drawings section. It's nothing great, but it felt like too much time had passed since the last time I put pictures online.
