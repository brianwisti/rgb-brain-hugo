I just packed up the latest release ofÂ  [pagetemplate](pagetemplate.md) and sent it out into the wild. New features?

* It works under ruby 1.6 now - you no longer need Ruby CVS to use this little toy!
* Experimental support for caching! If you don't know what this is, don't worry about it for now. I'll come up with a decent explanation when it's working better :-)

No new features are planned for the near future, just some big-time code scrubbing.
