title: 'New Geekery Topic: Ruby'

I have been fiddling with Ruby for a while now, but just started getting serious about it over the last week. I thought, "what the heck, a  [Ruby](../../../card/Ruby.md) topic sounds like a good idea." Not much there right now. A few links, and that is about it.

Oh, and I decided that the DHTML menu was just too ugly to live. I've replaced it with a PHP-constructed CSS2 menu. There are a few things that I want to do with it (like make it a little more browser-safe), but it works.

If you want to see some browser-busting uses of CSS, be sure to check out Eric A. Meyer's [css/edge](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/) site.
