title: Nifty Python Templating Thingy
date: 2002-04-28

NPTT? That's a horrible acronym. Anyhow, I've taken a break from Ruby programming stuff to ... uhh ... do Python programming stuff. Maybe we're talking about a little bit of obsessiveness, yes?

The fruit of my day's labor is a templating mechanism inspired by Perl's HTML::Template module. It allows simple variable substitution, if structures, and loops. I'm planning on spending this week cleaning up the code and figuring out distutils. Once I'm confident that it will install and work in most circumstances without blowing anything up, I'll make it available on the site.
