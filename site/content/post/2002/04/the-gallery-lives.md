*Whew!* I have spent the last week or so working out a decent  *Gallery*  to show off photos and drawings. It is finally done. It needs a few things, like a few nifty graphics and ... well ... some more images.

In other news, I decided to put the [processed VIM documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20020601120117/http://www.coolnamehere.com/vim/vimdoc/help.html) back on the site. All you geeky UNIX folks, enjoy!
