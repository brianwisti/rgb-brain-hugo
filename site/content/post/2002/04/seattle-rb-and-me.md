I attended the monthly [Seattle.rb meeting](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://www.zenspider.com/seattle.rb), and it was a lot of fun. Mostly educational, because all of these guys were more experienced than me. There was pair programming *(it's a long story - go look up "Extreme Programming" on [Google](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://www.google.com/))*. There was meeting geeks. I learned a bit about Unit Testing. Plus, it was in the "cool" part of town, so I got to see some impressive tattoo jobs.
