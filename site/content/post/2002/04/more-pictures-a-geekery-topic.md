title: More Pictures + a Geekery Topic
date: 2002-04-04

I've been digging around in my hard drive over the last week or so, and found a few pictures to add to the  *Gallery* . There's also a new *UNIX toolbox* topic for the *Geekery* section. The Toolbox section provides a spot for me to share my notes on using the many many tools available to developers under UNIX-like systems (including [Linux](../../../card/Linux.md) and FreeBSD).
