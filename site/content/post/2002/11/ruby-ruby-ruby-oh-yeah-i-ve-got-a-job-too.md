title: Ruby Ruby Ruby — oh yeah I've got a job too
date: 2002-11-16

Okay. postNuke is long gone. It's a fine tool, but it wasn't what I wanted to do with my free time. Yeah, I have to think about free time again, because I've just started working at the [Omni Group](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://omnigroup.com/) as a tech support person. The job is great, and the people are great. Plus, it's a Mac shop, so I'm surrounded by machines running OS X. It may not be Linux, but it's a much better environment for me than Windows. Life being the odd thing that it is, I am working with [ZenSpider](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://www.zenspider.com/), a classmate from high school who also happens to be a freakishly skilled programmer. He's very active with  [Ruby](../../../card/Ruby.md) , and has also been teaching me *(indirectly and possibly without his full awareness)* about the wonders of unit testing and [Extreme Programming](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) - stupid name, but a lot of good ideas.

So I've been working hard on grasping the finer points of Ruby, especially the Ruby/Tk GUI toolkit. There's an [excellent tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://httpd.chello.nl/k.vangelder/ruby/learntk/) on the subject, but not much else. I have found myself digging around in the tk.rb code, and looking for quick and dirty guides to Tcl/Tk. If you have any suggestions, please [let me know](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://www.coolnamehere.com/brian/index.html).

Oh yeah, and the  Ruby Geekery  section is back up. Not much there, but ... you know, someday.
