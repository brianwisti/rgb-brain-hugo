I've spend the last couple of weeks trying to get Ruby/Tk working natively under Mac OS X. It's a real challenge - especially since I'm not that much of a programmer. I write a mean script, but I'm a long ways from finding and fixing obscure bugs. Anyhow, I've added that to the Ruby *project*  page.

Fabrizio Lippolis was kind enough to point out that I had a typographical error on *Simple Types in Python*. It's fixed now. Thanks for pointing that out!

Okay, now I'm going back to playing Civilization 3 and then figuring out how Tcl/Tk works. I hope everybody enjoys the holidays and the new year!
