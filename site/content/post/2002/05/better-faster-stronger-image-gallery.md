title: Better Faster Stronger Image Gallery

I love three day weekends. I worked my way through using RubyPhoto, and now the *Gallery* is redone with a tool that I like, and it's ready for new pictures! Really. Check it out. There's a lot of pictures there that weren't up yesterday.

A side thought: RubyPhoto and ZenWeb are great tools, but using them is awkward. They need good front-ends. Hmmmm ... I might have a couple new projects to do :-).
