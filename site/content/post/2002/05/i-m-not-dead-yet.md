Okay. You can't tell from the site, but I have been very busy. That Ruby Templating thing is ready for use. Now, I just have to figure out how CGI works under Ruby!Â *...sigh...*

Instead of the now hopelessly damaged 'template.py' script, you might want to look at the Ruby Template demo page to get an idea of the basic progress of the templating engine.

It's bedtime now, but I had to get another simple example done. Check out this very ... chunky ... guestbook, written in Ruby and taking advantage of my PageTemplate package.

So what's my plan now? I'm going to write up some documentation. You know, tutorials, API guidelines, stuff like that. Nothing fancy, but I want people to be able to use it as soon as they download it. That's just the kinda guy I am.
