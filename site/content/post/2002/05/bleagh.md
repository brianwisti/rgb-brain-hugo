My current contract is filling up a lot of my time. That's okay, though - money is always a nice thing. It means that I don't have as much time to monkey with the gallery, though. Oh well. I found the [RubyPhoto](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://plig.net/~ture/rubyphoto/) package, though, and it does exactly what I want. Once I figure out how to use it and fit it into the formatting of the rest of the site, expect *lots* of pictures to go back up.

Oh, and I think I figured out what was missing from the Site Map page. Just a little Renderer class, no big deal. I only missed it because it was merely obvious. Something has to be blindingly obvious before it catches my eye.
