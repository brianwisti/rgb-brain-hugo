30 years old, and I just got my driver's license today. Guess I was too busy drawing and messing with the computers to learn. Eventually you get tired of doing your shopping two bags at a time, and relying on the kindness of friends for long-distance trips. Honestly, though, it feels *really* cool to have it.
