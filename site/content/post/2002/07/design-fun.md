I've noticed that I've been doing very little with the site (or much of anything else) recently. I realized that part of the problem was that I've spent almost all of my free time coding. Not much time making pretty things. "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy," as the axe-wielding psychopath in The Shining would remind us. After looking at sites like [PixelDecor](https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://www.pixeldecor.com/), it was time to use the right side of my brain a bit. So now I'm playing with Dreamweaver. I figure if I want to write code, I can do something besides HTML.
