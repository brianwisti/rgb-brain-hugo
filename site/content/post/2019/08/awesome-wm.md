full screenshots are a bit unwieldy with dual monitors.

There's been way too much "it just works (more or less)" in my desktop life lately, so I started using the [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org) tiling window manager.

Disappointingly, it works just fine.

Still, good chance to learn enough [Lua](../../../card/Lua.md) to customize my setup. Looks like I'll be revisiting [kitty-terminal](../05/kitty-terminal.md) and a few other tools that have been on the task list for a while.
