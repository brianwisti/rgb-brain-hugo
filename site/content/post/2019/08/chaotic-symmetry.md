I wish I drew this one larger. Then again, I thought it was going to be a quick bedtime sketch. Ended up spending probably around 40 hours on it.

I particularly enjoyed enabling and disabling symmetry at different stages. Made for what feels to me like a more organic image. If I were to go back and change anything, it might be to make foreground and background a little easier to differentiate. Use different brushes, maybe.
