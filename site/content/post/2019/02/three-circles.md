That [circle template](../01/circular-grids-with-python-and-pillow.md) I mentioned a couple weeks ago? Well, I made it so I could draw stuff like this!

Spent about a month on it, an hour or so at a time. Will I do it again? Of course! Will I do it regularly? Who knows? It took more patience than I'm used to, and I still haven't decided how much I like it.

I enjoyed figuring out the templates with code and then building on them manually. I also have ideas for some Celtic style images.

But first I need to get back to preparing a work talk.
