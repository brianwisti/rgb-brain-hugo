Grumbled on Twitter about the MBP TouchBar as a Vim user. [genehack](https://twitter.com/genehack) mentioned I could map Caps Lock to Control (my usual) *and* Escape, given the right tools. Ten minutes later I had [Karabiner Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) installed, a keyboard rule imported, and Vim happiness once again.

Definitely going to mess more with Karabiner.
