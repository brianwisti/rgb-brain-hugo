$ task '(+learn or +idea)' count
117

I know I won't get to 90% of these, but I'm glad to have [Taskwarrior](../../../card/Taskwarrior.md) for jotting them down.

Curious about the latest? I want to try out the [entropic](https://github.com/entropic-dev/entropic) package manager for (mostly) JavaScript.
