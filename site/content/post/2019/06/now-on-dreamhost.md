title: Now on Dreamhost
---

The site’s moved from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) to [Dreamhost](https://dreamhost.com)!

Nothing wrong with AWS S3 for static site hosting, but some of what I want to do is easier to describe in a shell. Also – I don’t mind paying for a service, but I got tired of usage-based billing. I ended up literally paying for typos more than a few times. Give me a predictable bill please.
