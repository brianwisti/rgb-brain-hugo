Yep. I love the Notes experiment. It encourages me to post quick thoughts frequently.

Iâ€™m officially assimilating Notes into the main flow of the site. That means tags instead of their own taxonomy. It also means they get listed with posts in the blog

Got a few ideas for a tidy separation of the two, but for taxonomy and history we are back to one main flow.
