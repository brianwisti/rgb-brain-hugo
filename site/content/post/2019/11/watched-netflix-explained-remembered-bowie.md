We watched the "Code" episode of Netflix's [explained](https://www.netflix.com/title/80216752).There's only so much that can be covered in 24 minutes, but I enjoyed the high level overview of concepts, history, and issues they presented within their constraints.

One of many iconic snippets  -- I may do an explainer post if I don't find  somebody else's first -- was from this 1999 interview of David Bowie. [Paleofuture](https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/watching-david-bowie-argue-with-an-interviewer-about-th-1791017656) posted a handy transcript of the highlights.

I would have been skeptical in 1999 about "nihilistic." But after seeing things  people do for the [lulz](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lulz)? Yeah, nihilistic.

That summarizes the last twenty years, from Netflix to Facebook to 4chan to FOSS to [30-50 Feral Hogs](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-50-feral-hogs) and beyond.
