[WelshPixie](http://delsdoodles.com/) draws amazing mandala images. Inspired me to do something in [Linea Sketch](https://linea-app.com/), a drawing app defined by its constraints. No symmetry tools. A focused approach to color palettes. Brushes limited to a couple pencils, a couple pens. Five layers, no more and no less. Stuff like that.

It does have circle and straight edge drawing tools, which I clearly took full advantage of.

The only feature I miss in Linea is custom canvas sizes. All drawings are exactly however many pixels your iPad has.
