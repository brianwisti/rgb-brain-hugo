Probably my favorite comment about [Art Nouveau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau).

![Where the 1960s "psychedelic" look came from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vuqI2v2IRs)

Whoa. The Wikipedia entry mentions that it was called "Kalevala style" in Finland. Which — looking elsewhere — might be a little off. I mostly see references to [National Romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_nationalism), which is a bit of a mixed bag historically speaking. For Finland it was an urge to assert itself as a *nation* and not just some dirt swapped back and forth between Russia and Sweden. Writing down the [Kalevala](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Kalevala) was a part of that same movement.

And yeah [JRR Tolkien loved the Kalevala](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Kalevala), tying in another piece to hippy culture. I think every bookshelf I saw as a kid had a copy of The Lord of the Rings.
