title: Wanting WSL 2
---

Been impatiently waiting for the general release of *inbox/WSL* 2 -- the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). What's interesting about WSL 2?

 > 
 > WSL 2 delivers a much faster file system performance and full system call compatibility, which lets you run more applications like Docker!

Looks like it's scheduled to go out in the first half of 2020.  So I can either wait *several* months or switch my rarely-used Windows partition to the [Insider Ring](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/how-to-overview/).

I should at least wait until [Build 18917](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/06/12/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-18917/#VhwdYU5EDiYa7XDx.97) or later shows up in the Slow Ring
on [Flight Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/flight-hub/).

*fidgets a lot*

We'll see.
