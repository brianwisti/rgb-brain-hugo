I like this form better -- from the article linked above.

All this is besides the point. When [jmac](https://jmac.org/) writes a blog post, he shares it [on his Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jmacdotorg). Then he puts the tweet link in the blog post, encouraging folks to share or reply via the tweet.

I stole that for here.
