title: Seattle's Chinatown Gate
---

Colors are a lot brighter in my new neighborhood. [The gate](https://www.historylink.org/File/8485) was dedicated in 2008 to celebrate the neighborhood's [history](http://chinatownconnection.com/seattle-chinatown-history.htm).

That link also helps understand why "International District" and not just "Chinatown":

 > 
 > It is perhaps the only area in the continental United States where Chinese,
 > Japanese, Filipinos, African Americans, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Cambodians,
 > settled together and built one neighborhood.
