title: Saving some links from Perl 6 Weekly
---

Haven't done anything interesting related to [card/Raku](../../../card/Raku.md) for *years*, but I still subscribe to the [Perl 6 Weekly](https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/) blog. Several links caught my eye this week.

* [Jeff Goff](https://twitter.com/DrForr) started a fresh series on [implementing Template Toolkit in Perl 6](http://theperlfisher.com/index.php/2019/07/18/templates-and-a-clean-start/).
* Madeleine Goebel is making great progress on a GSOC project [making `perl6` produce executable binaries](https://yakshavingcream.blogspot.com/2019/07/flags-and-syscalls-and-modules-oh-my.html)
* Andrew Shitov wrote a pleasant baby steps sort of intro on [using NativeCall](https://perl6.online/2019/07/17/108-basic-use-of-nativecall/) for accessing C libraries from Perl 6.
* Some sort of Chef/Ansible style task runner, called [Sparrow6](https://github.com/melezhik/Sparrow6)

Anyways, back to work and Python, which is also fun!
