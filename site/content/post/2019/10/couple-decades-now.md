me as a young goofy man in 2000 or so

Twenty years ago — give or take a couple weeks — I started working as a  backend programmer [in tech](https://web.archive.org/web/20001018153353/http://www.cmiworldwide.com/) writing [Perl](../../../card/Perl.md) code for a real live paycheck, as opposed to [designing sites](https://web.archive.org/web/19980703072855/http://www.plazma.net/) for cigarette money from [local ISPs](http://l7.net/).

About six months later the outer layers of the [dot-com bubble](https://ideas.ted.com/an-eye-opening-look-at-the-dot-com-bubble-of-2000-and-how-it-shapes-our-lives-today/) frayed and I experienced my first layoff. Couple recessions and a few mental breakdowns later, I'm still at it!

I have no deep thoughts on the subject. I still like writing code, even when I hate it. I also enjoy eating. Being a programmer has made both these things easier.
