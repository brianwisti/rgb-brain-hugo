Decided I wanted a copy of "[Learning Perl 6](https://www.learningperl6.com/)" before it becomes "Learning [Raku](http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2019/10/larry-has-approved-renaming-perl-6-to-raku.html)". I give my bookshelf room for nostalgia, though the name shift to [Raku](../../../card/Raku.md) is understandable.

And of *course* I needed a physical copy of the 20th Anniversary [Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition).
