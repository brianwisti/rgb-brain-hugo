title: Slow walkers have inferior brains
---

Here's an interesting correlation from
[BBC News: Slow walking at 45 "a sign of faster aging"](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50015982):

 > 
 > In general, the slower walkers tended to show signs of "accelerated ageing" with their lungs, teeth and immune systems in worse shape than those who walked faster.
 > 
 > The more unexpected finding was that brain scans showed the slower walkers were more likely to have older-looking brains too.

As a fast walker who gets stuck behind slow walkers on the way to work, I endorse these findings.
