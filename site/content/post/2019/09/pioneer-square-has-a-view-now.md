We went out for dinner the other evening, and once the sun was no longer blasting directly in our eyes — yay for [precession of the equinoxes](https://www.britannica.com/science/precession-of-the-equinoxes) — we were treated to a hell of a sight.

Sunset view of Puget Sound from Main Street in Seattle

See, the [Alaskan Way Viaduct](https://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Photos-65-years-of-the-Alaskan-Way-Viaduct-13284852.php) has blocked any real view of the Puget Sound  from ground level since the 1950s. But it's [going away](https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/Viaduct/). Near Pioneer Square, it's gone. I can look right at the water.

Until they start building up that [juicy real estate](https://www.realchangenews.org/2019/03/13/goodbye-viaduct-hello-prime-real-estate), of course. But I'll enjoy it while I can.
