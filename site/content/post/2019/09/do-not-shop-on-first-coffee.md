three brands of bottled coffee

Got sidetracked while picking up breakfast stuff from [Uwajimaya](https://www.uwajimaya.com/). Should probably have finished my first cup of coffee before I left. Could have been worse. There was an entire boy band worth of that Babinski Cold Brew. I only took one.

Meanwhile, someone put a flyer on the apartment bulletin board for the [Earshot Jazz Festival](https://www.earshot.org/2019-earshot-jazz-festival/). Checked to see if any of the names were familiar. Most were new to me, but I recognized  — and enjoy — [Knife Knights](https://knifeknights.bandcamp.com/).

A jazz context makes more sense for Knife Knights than rap/hip-hop, which is where I usually see them filed. Heck, genres are meaningless anyways. My favorite music stores just arrange albums alphabetically.

Anyways, time to drink some coffee!
