## Where I am now

En route from [Federal Way](https://www.cityoffederalway.com), a suburb between Seattle and Tacoma, to [Tucson](https://www.visittucson.org), in Arizona's Sonora Desert. This will be an interesting shift after living in the Puget Sound area most of my life.

We agreed it was time for a *major* change, for a lot of reasons. Biggest two boil down to cost of living and the inevitable changes of an area over decades. I love Seattle and I've missed it since the day we moved to the suburbs a few years ago, but the Seattle in my mind? With Sit 'n' Spin, art theaters, and a general inclination towards letting California have all the billionaires? That city hasn't existed for a long time.

## Who I am around now

Let's see. There's [MrsGeek](../card/MrsGeek.md), the dogs Aka and Hoku, and the cats Barry and Jack.

## What I am doing now

Moving. Looking for work, though that is at a slower pace until we move.

Check out my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwisti/) if you're looking for a remote or hybrid mostly backend senior dev with reasonably strong [Python](../card/Python.md) skills, based in Tucson.

## What else?

* getting old; better than the alternative, but complaints range from perpetually blocked ear to fingernail ridges
* using [Obsidian](../card/Obsidian.md) for public notes, but spending most of my time in [Logseq](../card/Logseq.md).
* puttering with new ways to organize this site
