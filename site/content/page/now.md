# Where I am now

Living in [Federal Way](https://www.cityoffederalway.com), a suburb between Seattle and Tacoma. Been here over almost two years and frankly I still haven't gotten used to the suburbs.

# Who I am around now

Let's see. There are four humans and five critters. I am happily married to [one of](https://hackers.town/@IamMrsGeek) the humans. The other two are pretty cool.

The critters? Two dogs, three cats.

# What I am doing now

Looking for work. Check out my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwisti/) if you're looking for a remote or hybrid mostly backend senior dev with reasonably strong [Python](../card/Python.md) skills, based near Seattle.

# What else?

* getting old; better than the alternative, but complaints range from perpetually blocked ear to fingernail ridges
* studying enterprise technologies like [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) for greater confidence answering "yes" when someone asks if I know them
* using [Obsidian](../card/Obsidian.md) for notes
* puttering with new ways to organize this site

# Want more?
