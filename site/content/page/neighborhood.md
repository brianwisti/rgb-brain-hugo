I started asking everyone to [follow](follow.md) me a long time ago. But there has a big gap on this site: who *else* should you follow? Who do *I* follow?

Well here you go. This page lists the sites that I regularly check via [Fraidycat](https://fraidyc.at). Fraidycat uses a simpler organization than some other readers: there's a topic or section, usually described with an icon. Those sections are then divided into how frequently you want to check them.

The listing below is a little raw â€” just what Fraidycat provided in export. They're also incomplete. I pulled a couple of my data feeds and NSFW blogs where they forget to warn you that they're not work safe.

It's also incomplete because I'm still pulling in the sites I usually follow via Twitter.

Nevertheless! I wanted *something* I could point you to for suggestions. In an earlier age, this page would be "blogroll" but "neighborhood" describes it a little better for me. Nobody paid or asked to be on this list. Many of these folks are friends or at least people and projects I appreciate. My neighbors.
