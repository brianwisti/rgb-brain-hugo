Follow the blog, and follow me personally on social networks.

I automatically share new posts on [Mastodon](https://hackers.town/@randomgeek). [RSS](../card/RSS.md) is the best way to follow this site, though. It works even when my announcement scripts don't.

Subscribe to the Random Geekery blog by copying and pasting the link below --- the link itself, not the XML file you see if you click the link --- into your feed reader app!

Sometimes I have multiple feed links here. Those come and go based on my latest experiments, but the main one should stay pretty consistent.

[Main Feed](/index.xml)
: keep up with everything on the site; right now that's just blog posts, but sometimes it includes experiments with new non-post content types
