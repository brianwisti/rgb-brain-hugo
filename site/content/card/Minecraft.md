That big voxel survival game.

Takes a minute to warm up, especially when you have a lot of mods, and especially especially when you're doing this on Apple Silicon.

## Launchers

The default launcher for Bedrock and Java is fine. Really. But you'll need a launcher / instance manager if you go digging into mods frequently.

### MultiMC

### PolyMC

A fork of MultiMC. Main difference I've noticed so far is it connects to more mod sources.

## Modpacks

I mostly play kitchen sink modpacks, so there's a lot of variety for me as I wander amongst the pretty cubes.
