[tldr](tldr.md): Blog posts for today, cards for persistent thoughts. Store it in [Obsidian](Obsidian.md), build it with [Hugo](Hugo.md) and [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export)

# Purpose

Provide a relatively simple structure to let me use folders to organize information along a couple important splits:

## short-term vs long-term

I don't need to keep all my notes forever! Make it easy to see what notes still need to be refactored into some form of long-term memory.

## personal vs public

I want to share some of my notes, and maintaining separate vaults doesn't work for me. Make sure there's a designated spot for long-term private notes, but also put new notes in a (private) limbo where I know I need to refine and file them.

# Folders

|Folder|Purpose|
|------|-------|
|`_templates`|skeletal structures for notes|
|`attachments`|images and other non-text files|
|`card`|Long-term public notes|
|`inbox`|spot to capture and process new notes|
|`journal`|Private records|
|`journal/day`|Daily journal, some of which gets refactored|
|`journal/jots`|Long-term but private (contacts, etc)|
|`post`|Long-form structured material explicitly for a public audience|
|`reference`|What I read, watch, etc that adds info to other notes|

# Files

* Some folders get an `_index` file describing the contents of that folder.
