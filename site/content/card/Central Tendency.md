## Summary

The central or typical value chosen to represent a collection of values

## Jots

Used in [Data Analysis](Data%20Analysis.md) to identify trends, provide a comparison point, or draw quick conclusions about the overall data distribution

## Common Measures for Central Tendency

There's a bunch. See Wikipedia for a bigger list. These are just the ones I've seen often enough to merit entries.

### Mean

* sum of all the values, divided by the number of values
* useful for quick snapshots of data

### Median

* halfway between the minimum and maximum values in the data set
* less sensitive to frequently occurring values than *Mean*

### Mode

* the most frequently occurring value in a dataset
* examine along with *Mean* and *Median* to get a more representative view of data
