Parrot was a virtual machine that providing the base for [Raku](Raku.md) and a few [other languages](http://www.parrot.org/languages). I honestly can't tell you what its virtues were compared to other virtual machines, because I'm just not that well informed.

I spent some time  in [parrot-babysteps](../post/2009/07/parrot-babysteps.md) exploring PIR, the Parrot Intermediate Representation language. It's lower level than what I'm used to, but it was still fun to play with. 

The Parrot project itself retired in 2021. Raku uses MoarVM, and other language projects never really caught on.
