The [Programming Language](Programming%20Language.md) that's eating the world.

When I first got into Web programming, JavaScript was not my favorite language. It took too much work to get anything done, and then it wouldn’t work half the time on other browsers. That’s the other thing. It was only useful to most of us on Web browsers. [card/Perl](Perl.md) was funny-looking, but worked on nearly any machine and could make the most elaborate Web applications that worked regardless of what browser your visitor was using. You could even write applications that had nothing to do with the Web, using Perl/Tk and CPAN.

Well that was 1997, and a lot has happened since then. Perl is still funny-looking and capable of nearly anything, but it's faded as new generations of developers came onto the scene. JavaScript has become a much more powerful, dominating nearly every aspect of Web development and makes significant appearances in many other domains. Throw in a meaningful superset like [TypeScript](TypeScript.md) and you effectively have a different language. Big success story.
