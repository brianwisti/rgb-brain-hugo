## Summary

Examining and summarizing large data sets to identify trends and help organizations make strategic decisions.

## Jots

Related to and often tagged as *Data Science*. Data analysis is more about using past data to inform current decisions, while data science is trying to predict future outcomes based on available data.

### Relevant Categorizations

Should probably break these out into their own pages eventually.

Kinds of data: *categorical* or *numerical*, *discrete* or *continuous*

|Kind|Examples|
|----|--------|
|categorical|gender, location|
|numerical|number of customers, active users|
|discrete|number of applicants to a job|
|continuous|infinite possible outcomes|

Data characteristics:

|Characteristic|Explanation|
|--------------|-----------|
|cross-sectional|snapshot of pattern or trend|
|time series|test scores, wages over time|
|panel data|multiple subjects and multiple points in time|

dispersion
: how data is organized; *high dispersion* has a large range

confidence interval
: a range of values likely to include *population value* with a certain degree of confidence

sampling population
: selection of a subset of individuals from within a statistical population, used to estimate characteristics of the whole population

#### Basic Data Analysis #process

An iterative loop:

* *Define* your problem
* *Disassemble* the problems and data into smaller pieces
* *Evaluate* the problems and data to draw conclusions about what you've learned
* *Decide* on a course of action that solves the problem

#### Main Concepts for Data Analysis Workflow

Data Collection
: systematically gathering and measuring information about specific variables for later processing

Data Cleanup
: inspecting and processing raw data to improve its quality, integrity, and relevance to the problem at hand.

Data Exploration
: identifying patterns and anomalies in data while examining its structure, and testing hypotheses to confirm or clarify your understanding.

[Data Visualization](Data%20Visualization.md)

Statistical Analysis
: transforming data sets into information that can be used for understanding and decision-making.

Machine Learning
: a subset of [Artificial Intelligence](Artificial%20Intelligence.md) that allows an application to discern patterns and automatically improve its analysis of extremely large datasets over time.

#### Types of Data Analytics

Descriptive Analytics
: transforming data into more easily understood forms through summarization, organization, and simplification

Diagnostic Analytics
: examines historical data and connections within its chronology to understand the *root cause* of observed changes.

Predictive Analytics
: identifies patterns in existing data which may be used to forecast future outcomes and trends.

Prescriptive Analytics
: builds on *Predictive Analytics* to recommend actions based on known parameters, anticipating future outcomes and explaining why those outcomes will take place.
