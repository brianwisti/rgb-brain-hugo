# Python

 > 
 > Python is a [Programming Language](Programming%20Language.md) that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

Convincing people to give Python a try used to take a lot more work.

## Pyenv

[GitHub - pyenv/pyenv: Simple Python version management](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

For managing your Python installations. I use `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv`.

### Pyenv Dependencies

[Pyenv wiki: Suggested build environment](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment)

Ubuntu:

````
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
    libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl \
    libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev \
    libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
````

Arch:

````bash
yay -S --needed base-devel openssl zlib xz tk
````
