More than a text editor, it's a lifestyle.

Okay, so what are the main tasks I use Emacs for?

* Editing text files of course, including but not limited to:
  * Notes and task management via [Org](Org.md)
  * Source code for Ruby, Perl, Python, LISP, and JavaScript projects
* The scratch buffer makes a handy calculator, since it can evaluate LISP code.

My main advice to you if you want to use Emacs: do more than just edit text with it. Use it as a calculator. Let it handle your email. Play Tetris with it. Experiment and have a little fun.

What’s that? "Play Tetris with it?" Yes, that’s right. I said "Tetris".
`M-x tetris` and see for yourself.
