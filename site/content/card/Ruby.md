A friendly object-oriented [Programming Language](Programming%20Language.md).

I say that I do not have a favorite programming language. If I did have a favorite language, it might be Ruby. I’ve been messing around with it randomly for years, and I am continually amazed by how easy it is to build programs with it. Ruby strives to be a delight to work with.

It operates on The Principle Of Least Surprise, which basically means that code does what it looks like it’s supposed to, with a minimum of surprises or clever tricks.

Too bad I'm not as big a fan of Rails, or I could've made a lot of money for a while there.
