A collection of libraries to make command line apps better with [Ruby](Ruby.md).

Comparable to [Rich](Rich.md), but presented as distinct components rather than a full framework.

## Components I've used

[tty-command](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-command)
: straightforward interface to launching executables and capturing output

[tty-editor](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-editor)
: launch `$EDITOR`

[tty-file](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-file)
: file handling utilities

[tty-logger](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-logger)
: much improved debug logging

[tty-prompt](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-prompt)
: interactive user prompts

[tty-table](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-table)
: pretty print tables

[tty-tree](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-tree)
: pretty print data trees
