An attempt at sharing my notes online, like a more freeform version of what I did with [coolnamehere](coolnamehere.md). Mental friction of maintaining multiple sites resulted in me taking it down before it started to rot.

I liked the idea though, and shifted the angle into making my [PKM](PKM.md) the [CMS](CMS.md) for [Random Geekery](Random%20Geekery.md). I imported the posts into a new [Obsidian](Obsidian.md) vault, and refactored â€“ extracting note cards from recurring topics, refactoring or removing some posts that no longer felt right as blog posts.

The note cards start out pretty raw, but that's okay. I fill them out with details from other PKM resources or fresh lookups as I need them.

Still ironing out the details of publishing the new hybrid site, but it currently involves [Hugo](Hugo.md), [obsidian-export](obsidian-export.md), and some support scripts.
