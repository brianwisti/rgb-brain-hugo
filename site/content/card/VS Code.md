Cross-platform multi-language text editor from *Microsoft* for programmers and others.

# Key bindings

There's a lot of them, but search is the one I really want to drill into my head.

|Key  |Action              |
|------|---------------------------|
|`C-f`|search in document  |
|`C-F`|search in workspace|
