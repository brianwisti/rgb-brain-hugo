An [Artificial Intelligence](Artificial%20Intelligence.md) image generation model focused on photorealistic outputs

## Jots

**SDXL** is the latest iteration as of 2023.

## Frontends

*Stable Diffusion* primarily describes the model itself. You need some kind of frontend to actually generate images with it.

I'm trying it with [ComfyUI](ComfyUI.md).
