RIP `coolnamehere.com` 2000 - 2013

Once upon a time I kept my stuff on a different Web site.

coolnamehere was an organized collection of notes mostly about programming, organized by folders into topic and subtopic.  Then I missed the
email to renew the domain registration. Oh well.

Those notes — or their ashes — are scattered throughout these notes.
