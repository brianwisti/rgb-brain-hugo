A readable format for plain text that can be parsed and transformed by computer programs

I usually need it to become HTML, or parsed to extract useful data

## Languages

The ones I spend the most time with.

* [Markdown](Markdown.md)
* [reStructuredText](reStructuredText.md)
* [Asciidoctor](Asciidoctor.md)
* [Org](Org.md)
