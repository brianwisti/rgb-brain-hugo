Generally, when you can define your system architecture in some sort of [DSL](DSL.md) than can be stored in [Git](Git.md), and either be directly read by orchestration tools or compiled into something they do understand.

A broad enough field that the Wikipedia definition just says "machine-readable," but that sounds to me like a configuration I would be generating via some pointy-clicky GUI. Where's the fun in that?
