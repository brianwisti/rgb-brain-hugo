This is more or less my vanilla-ish [Emacs](../../card/Emacs.md) playground. I start from [nano-emacs](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs).  It's pretty and pretty useful.  But expect it to veer pretty far from that base over time.

## Foundations {#foundations}

### Give Emacs some breathing room {#give-emacs-some-breathing-room}

`max-specpdl-size` sets the upper limit for how many variable bindings and `unwind-protect` Emacs allows.  `max-lisp-eval-depth` says how deep we can get into a recursive function call.

I got the RAM so let's go past the respective defaults of 1600 and 800.

<a id="code-snippet--set resource limits"></a>

````elisp
(setq max-specpdl-size 3200)
(setq max-lisp-eval-depth 3200)
````

And of course I'm sure to screw something up so let's make sure the debugger is enabled for when I do.

<a id="code-snippet--set debug-on-error"></a>

````elisp
(setq debug-on-error t)
````

### Enable local lisp {#enable-local-lisp}

<a id="code-snippet--enable local lisp"></a>

````elisp
(let ((default-directory  (expand-file-name "lisp" user-emacs-directory)))
  (setq load-path
        (append
         (let ((load-path  (copy-sequence load-path))) ;; Shadow
           (append
            (copy-sequence (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '(".")))
            (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)))
         load-path)))
````

### Simplify reloading my config {#simplify-reloading-my-config}

I putter with this config marginally less than I did initially - progress! - but enough that restarting Emacs for every config tweak gets tedious.

One of the ideas I grabbed from Vianney Lebouteiller's [Emacs config](https://irfu.cea.fr/Pisp/vianney.lebouteiller/emacs.html).

<a id="code-snippet--enable reloading init"></a>

````elisp
(defun reload-init-file ()
  (interactive)
  (load-file user-init-file))

(global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'reload-init-file)
````

### Use straight.el to install packages {#use-straight-dot-el-to-install-packages}

[`straight.el`](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) is my new friend.

#### `early-init.el` {#early-init-dot-el}

But if I'm using `straight.el` I better disable `package.el` during the *early init*
stage.

<a id="code-snippet--disable package in early init"></a>

````elisp
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
````

#### Bootstrap `straight.el` {#bootstrap-straight-dot-el}

Boilerplate from the `straight.el` documentation.

<a id="code-snippet--add straight.el boilerplate"></a>

````elisp
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
      (bootstrap-version 5))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
````

#### Integrate with `use-package` {#integrate-with-use-package}

I tried to avoid [use-package](https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/) here for a more "minimal" setup. That did not work.
Since `straight.el` plays nice with `use-package`, let's let it do that.

<a id="code-snippet--integrate straight with use-package"></a>

````elisp
(straight-use-package 'use-package)

(use-package straight
  :custom
  (straight-use-package-by-default t))
````

## General Usability {#general-usability}

### General guidelines for text handling {#general-guidelines-for-text-handling}

Where to put the fill column marker for line wraps, how many pixels to put between lines, stuff like that.

<a id="code-snippet--set text handling guidelines"></a>

````elisp
(setq fill-column 80)
(setq-default line-spacing 1)
````

### invoke `M-x` without `Alt` {#invoke-m-x-without-alt}

I read Steve Yegge's [effective-emacs](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs) a *long* time ago â€” back when it was an internal Amazon blog. Applied his suggestion to invoke `X-m` with `C-x C-m` and that's been part of my Emacs muscle memory ever since.

<a id="code-snippet--use C-x C-m for M-x"></a>

````elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-m") 'execute-extended-command)
````

### Make a few adjustments for running on macOS {#make-a-few-adjustments-for-running-on-macos}

Make sure the macOS Emacs GUI app picks up environment variables.

<a id="code-snippet--use exec-path-from-shell"></a>

````elisp
(use-package exec-path-from-shell
  :ensure
  :init (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
````

macOS doesn't use GNU Coreutils and of course its `ls` isn't what
`dired` expects. Adjust for that.

<a id="code-snippet--handle ls on macOS"></a>

````elisp
(if (string-equal system-type "darwin")
    (setq dired-use-ls-dired nil))
````

### `visual-fill-column` for a nice soft wrap {#visual-fill-column-for-a-nice-soft-wrap}

<a id="code-snippet--use visual-fill-column"></a>

````elisp
(use-package visual-fill-column
  :commands visual-fill-column-mode

  :custom
  (fill-column-enable-sensible-window-split t)

  :bind
  (("C-x p" . 'visual-fill-column-mode)))
````

## Aesthetics {#aesthetics}

### Fonts {#fonts}

The *Roboto Mono* font that NANO wants is **not** part of any `*roboto*` package I
found in Pop! OS repositories.  Ended up going to [Font Library](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/roboto-mono) for a direct
download.

With that note out of the way - I still lean towards [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans).

<a id="code-snippet--set font faces"></a>

````elisp
(setq bmw/face-height-default
      (if (eq system-type 'darwin)
          180
        140))

(set-face-attribute 'default t
                    :background "#000000"
                    :foreground "#ffffff"
                    :family "FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font"
                    :height bmw/face-height-default)

(setq nano-font-family-monospaced "FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font")
(setq nano-font-size (/ bmw/face-height-default 10))
````

## Configure `nano` {#configure-nano}

### Install `nano` and its dependencies {#install-nano-and-its-dependencies}

Installing via `straight.el`.

<a id="code-snippet--install nano"></a>

````elisp
(straight-use-package
 '(nano-emacs :type git :host github :repo "rougier/nano-emacs"))
````

### Load the Nano layout {#load-the-nano-layout}

<a id="code-snippet--require nano-layout"></a>

````elisp
(require 'nano-layout)
````

### Define my colors {#define-my-colors}

Because I'm the kind of person I am: setting the nano theme colors to match my
own tacky tastes. Maybe not *tacky* but certainly not as refined as the author of
nano.

This particular set of colors comes from the [Spaceduck](https://pineapplegiant.github.io/spaceduck/) theme.

<a id="code-snippet--use spaceduck colors in nano"></a>

````elisp
(defun nano-theme-set-spaceduck ()
  (setq frame-background-mode 'dark)
  (setq nano-color-foreground "#ecf0c1")
  (setq nano-color-background "#0f111b")
  (setq nano-color-highlight  "#1b1c36")
  (setq nano-color-critical   "#e33400")
  (setq nano-color-salient    "#00a4cc")
  (setq nano-color-strong     "#e39400")
  (setq nano-color-popout     "#f2ce00")
  (setq nano-color-subtle     "#7a5ccc")
  (setq nano-color-faded      "#b3a1e6"))

(nano-theme-set-spaceduck)
````

### Set up font faces {#set-up-font-faces}

I feel comfortable loading `nano-faces` for font rules now that I've defined my colors.
Will need to fuss a bit more in a second though.

<a id="code-snippet--require nano-faces"></a>

````elisp
(require 'nano-faces)
(nano-faces)
````

Want to overload some of the defaults, though. nano-emacs does not
like to show bold text when using Fantasque Sans Mono.

<a id="code-snippet--use bold face in nano"></a>

````elisp
(set-face-attribute 'nano-face-strong nil
                    :foreground (face-foreground 'nano-face-default)
                    :weight 'bold)
````

### Let nano theme everything {#let-nano-theme-everything}

`nano-theme` maps those custom faces to pretty much everything everywhere.
Pretty nice.

<a id="code-snippet--require nano-theme"></a>

````elisp
(require 'nano-theme)
(nano-theme)
````

*Except* for this little thing where it disables bold for graphical displays? I think?  I'm still learning how all this works.

I know **I** like bold, though. *And* italics, now that you mention it.

<a id="code-snippet--reassert bold face in nano"></a>

````elisp
(set-face-attribute 'bold nil :weight 'bold)
````

Once I have my base established, I should be able to load the nano theme.

### Load nano defaults {#load-nano-defaults}

<a id="code-snippet--require nano-defaults"></a>

````elisp
(require 'nano-defaults)
````

### Enable nano session handling {#enable-nano-session-handling}

<a id="code-snippet--require nano-session"></a>

````elisp
(require 'nano-session)
````

### Enable the nano modeline {#enable-the-nano-modeline}

One of my favorite bits really.

<a id="code-snippet--require nano-modeline>>"></a>

````elisp
(require 'nano-modeline)
````

### Enable nano key bindings {#enable-nano-key-bindings}

`C-x k`
: kill current buffer without asking

`M-n`
: open a new frame

`` M-` ``
: switch to other frame

`C-x C-c`
: delete the current frame; exit if no frames remain

`C-c r`
: interactive select from recent files

`<M-return>`
: toggle maximization of current frame' not sure if I like this one; it confuses org muscle memory, and if I want "maximized" I usually toggle tiling in the window manager

<!--listend-->

<a id="code-snippet--require nano-bindings"></a>

````elisp
(require 'nano-bindings)
````

### nano Counsel integration {#nano-counsel-integration}

`nano-counsel.el` is small. I'll just map its logic directly to some `use-package` magic.

<a id="code-snippet--use counsel like nano"></a>

````elisp
(use-package counsel
  :bind
  (("M-x" . 'counsel-recentf)
   ("C-x b" . 'counsel-bookmark)
   ("C-c r" . 'counsel-recentf)
   ("C-x C-b" . 'counsel-switch-buffer)
   ("C-c c" . 'counsel-org-capture)))

(use-package smex)
(use-package ivy
  :custom
  (ivy-height 4)
  (ivy-count-format "")
  (ivy-initial-inputs-alist: '((counsel-minor . "^+")
                               (counsel-package . "^+")
                               (counsel-org-capture . "^")
                               (counsel-M-x . "^")
                               (counsel-refile . "")
                               (org-agenda-refile . "")
                               (org-capture-refile . "")
                               (Man-completion-table . "^")
                               (woman . "^")))
  (ivy-use-virtual-buffers t)

  :init
  (setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t)

  :config
  (ivy-mode 1))
````

I need to give myself a little context here.

#### Ivy, Counsel, and Swiper {#ivy-counsel-and-swiper}

 > 
 > flexible, simple tools for minibuffer completion in Emacs

These are technically separate packages developed together in the [swiper](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) repo.

Ivy
: an alternative completion framework for Emacs

Counsel
: Ivy-enhanced alternatives to common Emacs commands

Swiper
: Ivy-enhanced alternative to Isearch

Loading `nano-counsel` failed with complaints about missing `smex`.
[Smex](https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex/) provides enhancements to `M-x` behavior, such as an interface to recent and commonly used commands.
Since I want my foundation to be a clean Nano experience, I install smex as well.

### nano splash {#nano-splash}

<a id="code-snippet--enable nano splash and help"></a>

````elisp
(let ((inhibit-message t))
  (message "Welcome to GNU Emacs / N Î› N O edition")
  (message (format "Initialization time: %s" (emacs-init-time))))

(require 'nano-splash)

(require 'nano-help)
````

## Life management with Org {#life-management-with-org}

Okay here we go. Building up my `org-roam` experience while keeping Deft handy for the longer, more intentional notes.

### File locations {#file-locations}

I work this out piecemeal, as some of the files and folders build on
what's been defined before.

First: what's the top level of everything? That depends on whether I'm
in a UNIX-like system or playing with the native Windows version of
Emacs.

<a id="code-snippet--set local root"></a>

````elisp
(setq bmw/local-root
      (if (string-equal system-type "windows-nt")
          "C:/Users/brian"
        "~/"))
````

Trying an experiment where first we look for a local `~org/` folder and
use that if found, otherwise going with my actual default of
`~/Dropbox/org`. Trying to shift over to git-synchronized Org files
instead of Dropbox-synchronized, but that change will take a bit to
percolate through all my systems.

<a id="code-snippet--set base directories from root"></a>

````elisp
(setq bmw/default-org-directory (expand-file-name "org" bmw/local-root))
(setq bmw/sync-org-directory (expand-file-name "Dropbox/org" bmw/local-root))

(setq bmw/org-dir
      (if (file-directory-p bmw/default-org-directory)
          bmw/default-org-directory
        bmw/sync-org-directory))
````

That's enough to define most of the files I need.

<a id="code-snippet--define values for specific files"></a>

````elisp
(setq
 bmw/current-journal (expand-file-name "journal.org" bmw/org-dir)
 bmw/org-id-locations-file (expand-file-name
                            ".org-id-locations" bmw/org-dir)
 bmw/org-roam-directory (expand-file-name "roam" bmw/org-dir))
````

Oh, one more thing. I want to include `org-roam` files in my Org
agenda. I found [helpful instructions](https://d12frosted.io/posts/2021-01-16-task-management-with-roam-vol5.html), but I'm not adding that code to
my config until I understand it. Maybe if I follow the link to the
*beginning* of the post series and start there.

What a novel idea.

But today? With my small collection of `org-roam` notes, I can get away
with directly including them in my agenda searches.

<a id="code-snippet--set agenda file list"></a>

````elisp
(setq bmw/org-agenda-files (list bmw/org-dir
                                 bmw/org-roam-directory
                                 (expand-file-name
                                  "daily" bmw/org-roam-directory)))
````

### Tumblelogging with ox-hugo {#tumblelogging-with-ox-hugo}

I started an experiment with using Org to drive a [tumblelog](https://kottke.org/05/10/tumblelogs) at [Random Geekery Life](https://randomgeekery.life). *Tumblelog* is an older term for a blog that mainly consists of dumping whatever thoughts, links, or just whatever. Sort of like Twitter or Tumblr, but on my own site and less constrained than a tweet-length [microblog](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-microblogging-3486200). Someday I may put more words elsewhere and replace this all this explanatory text with a link.

For now I build the visible tumblelog as a static site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It's quick and it's familiar.

Org enters the scene with a single file within my Hugo site.

<a id="code-snippet--set tumblelogging file"></a>

````elisp
(setq
 bmw/tumble-log (expand-file-name
                 "~/Sites/rgb-life/content-org/posts.org"))
````

That file contains all the content for the tumblelog, but the important part here is a function to dynamically generate a filename for [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) based on the current time.

<a id="code-snippet--define function for tumble template"></a>

````elisp
(defun bmw/build-tumble-template ()
  (format-spec
   "* NOW %%U %%?\n:properties:\n:export_file_name: %s.md\n:end:\n"
   (list (cons ?s (format-time-string "%s")))))
````

Hugo configuration determines permalinks from post dates, which ox-hugo derives from task completion timestamps. If I want to keep all the times for an entry in sync I manually edit, but it's not a big deal yet. `C-t d` muscle memory so far is quicker than figuring out how to automate *that* process.

The actual filename gets ignored, but the epoch timestamp keeps each output file unique at my normal human rate of adding entries.

<div class="note">

This also squeaks me past the fact that I came up with this version of the template after I already had a few entries.

</div>

Then when I'm building `org-capture-templates` I create a `datetree` entry for tumblelogging.

<a id="code-snippet--add tumble capture template"></a>

````elisp
("t" "Tumblelog" entry
 (file+olp+datetree bmw/tumble-log "Posts")
 (function bmw/build-tumble-template))
````

### Custom keywords {#custom-keywords}

A process vagiuely similar to [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) but my brain insists on its own task
classifications.

LATER
: I need to do it, but it can wait (or it's waiting on something)

NOW
: I got everything I need to do this

MAYBE
: An idea, suggestion, or action that I may or may not want to to

PROJECT
: A multi-part task with notable dependencies

DONE
: I did it!

NOPE
: Never mind

<!--listend-->

<a id="code-snippet--define org keywords"></a>

````elisp
(setq bmw/todo-keywords
      `((sequence
         "LATER(l!)" "NOW(n!)" "MAYBE(m!)" "PROJECT(p!)"

         "DONE(d!)" "NOPE(-!)")))
````

### `CUSTOM_ID` generation via writequit {#custom-id-generation-via-writequit}

Grabbing directly from [this post](https://writequit.org/articles/emacs-org-mode-generate-ids.html).

More to keep my `org-roam-ui` graph in order than for publishing, but
hopefully it'll come in handy there too.

### Additional Org tools {#additional-org-tools}

#### Deft {#deft}

The perfect solution for knowledge management varies by context. But the core thing really needed: someplace to drop my notes where I can find them when I need them.

[Deft](https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) provides exactly that. And since Org mode is the main reason I load Emacs, my `~/org` folder is where Deft will look for notes.

I don't want `org-roam` notes obscuring the more persistent notes in my Org folder. Better ignore them. Also the `org-brain` stuff until I have a good handle on that.

<a id="code-snippet--use deft"></a>

````elisp
(use-package deft
  :custom (deft-extensions '("org")) (deft-directory bmw/org-dir)
  (deft-recursive-ignore-dir-regexp "\\(?:\\.\\|\\.\\.\\|roam\\|brain\\)")
  (deft-ignore-file-regexp "\\(?:~\\|py\\)$")
  (deft-recursive t))
````

<div class="note">

Helpful hint when enabling `deft-recursive: =../` is one of the entries in your directory listing, and Deft will do its darndest to follow it if you forget to include it in `deft-recursive-ignore-dir-regexp` (set to `"\\(?:\\.\\|\\.\\.\\)"` by default).

This can lead to all sorts of recursive headaches, so don't forget!

</div>

Of course I'll end up tweaking it. But to get me started?

"Ask deft about my notes" is more than sufficient.

#### org-roam {#org-roam}

Taking advantage of [`org-roam-dailies`](https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#Org_002droam-Dailies) for journaling.  I started by

I like to always see backlinks as a side-window of my current view.

<a id="code-snippet--define org-roam side window"></a>

````elisp
(add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
             '("\\*org-roam\\*"
               (display-buffer-in-side-window)
               (side . right)
               (slot . 0)
               (window-width . 0.33)
               (window-parameters . ((no-other-window t)
                                     (no-delete-other-windows . t)))))
````

Something is off with my `:bind` and `:bind-keymap` settings for `org-roam`.
Until I learn enough to fix that, I'll make a global binding for the
one I care about: going to today's daily note.

<a id="code-snippet--reassert binding for org-roam-dailies-goto-today"></a>

````elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") 'org-roam-dailies-goto-today)
````

#### `org-roam-ui` {#org-roam-ui}

For the pretty. Sometimes I enable `org-roam-ui-mode` on load.

<a id="code-snippet--use org-roam-ui"></a>

````elisp
(use-package org-roam-ui
  :straight
    (:host github :repo "org-roam/org-roam-ui" :branch "main" :files ("*.el" "out"))
    :after org-roam
    ;; :hook (after-init . org-roam-ui-mode)
    :config
    (setq org-roam-ui-sync-theme t
          org-roam-ui-follow t
          org-roam-ui-update-on-save t
          org-roam-ui-open-on-start t))
````

#### `ox-hugo` {#ox-hugo}

Although [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) isn't *required* to use Hugo with Emacs, it sure does simplify things.

<a id="code-snippet--use ox-hugo"></a>

````elisp
(use-package ox-hugo
  :after ox)

## Project management with Projectile and friends {#project-management-with-projectile-and-friends}

[Projectile](https://projectile.mx/) plus a `.dir-locals.el` file seems like the right way to
handle development projects without bumping into everything else.

<a id="code-snippet--use projectile"></a>

````elisp
(use-package projectile
  :ensure t

  :init
  (projectile-mode +1)

  :bind
  (:map projectile-mode-map
        ("s-p" . projectile-command-map)
        ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)))

## `lsp-mode` and related for an IDE experience {#lsp-mode-and-related-for-an-ide-experience}

[`lsp-mode`](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/) adds support for Microsoft's [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/). Hypothetically that means easier setup of commonly desired
features like linting and autocompletion.

`lsp-mode` uses [YASnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet) for abbreviation and expansion.

<a id="code-snippet--use yasnippet"></a>

````elisp
(use-package yasnippet)
````

`nano-modeline` and `lsp-mode`'s breadcrumb trail wrestle with each other
for space on that top line. Maybe someday I can figure out how to
stack them. Until then, I like the modeline and its placement more
than I like the breadcrumb.

<a id="code-snippet--use lsp-mode"></a>

````elisp
(use-package lsp-mode
  :custom
  (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil)

  :init
  (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c C-l")

  :hook ((python-mode . lsp-deferred)
         (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration))

  :commands lsp)

(use-package lsp-ui :commands lsp-ui-mode)

(use-package lsp-ivy :commands lsp-ivy-workspace-symbol)

(use-package lsp-treemacs
  :after (lsp-mode treemacs)

  :config
  (lsp-treemacs-sync-mode 1)

  :commands lsp-treemacs-errors-list)

## Programming Languages {#programming-languages}

### Python {#python}

Pyenv for Python versions.

<a id="code-snippet--use pyenv"></a>

````elisp
(use-package pyvenv
  :ensure t
  :init
  (setenv "WORKON_HOME" "~/.pyenv/versions"))
````

I manage my projects with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). [poetry.el](https://github.com/galaunay/poetry.el) offers a nice Magit-like
interface to managing and maintaining Poetry projects.

In particular, it *might* simplify venv handling when I get to linting
tools and language server providers.

<a id="code-snippet--use poetry"></a>

````elisp
(use-package poetry
  :ensure t
  :config
  (poetry-tracking-mode))
````

## Which Key? {#which-key}

[`which-key`](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key) adds a completion panel for commands. That helps me learn
the many Emacs key maps.

<a id="code-snippet--use which-key"></a>

````elisp
(use-package which-key
  :defer 0
  :diminish which-key-mode
  :config
  (which-key-mode)
  (setq which-key-idle-delay 1))
````

## Treemacs {#treemacs}

[Treemacs](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs) is a file explorer sidebar. That part is kind of "meh" for
me.  The outliner provided by [`lsp-treemacs`](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-treemacs) interests me much more.

<div class="note">

To get Treemacs and nano playing nice I had to comment out line 515 of
`nano-modeline.el` in my local copy of nano.

````elisp
;; (setq-default mode-line-format "")
