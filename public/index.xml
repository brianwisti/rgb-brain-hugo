<dt><a href="https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/human-curation/">I miss human curation</a></dt>
<dd>Cassidy&rsquo;s correct that the human-curated Web is still here — I mean hello it me — and also correct that it&rsquo;s a lot harder to find thanks to algorithm-driven social networks and search engines; guess we&rsquo;ll have to go back to old-fashioned ways like blogrolls, webrings, bookmark pages, and variations like this weekly review</dd>

<dd>predicting that more LLM spam and the &ldquo;AI&rdquo; boom in general will result in more people splitting off from the old big social networks and platforms, being more creative to differentiate between the plausible mediocrity generated by automated systems; I would love for it to be true</dd>

Shared notes. Not too much. Mostly links.
I want to call them “weekly notes.” I lack confidence in my time awareness, so let’s go with “snapshot.” But hey. I fill up my notes every day. Why not share some of the interesting items here from time to time?

  <description>I’m not saying it’s good. I’m not saying I’ll stick with it. I just wanted to pull solidly away from the utility-class CSS I was using for a while there. Got real hard to tweak.
So for the moment, a slightly tweaked layout I used regularly a couple years ago.</description>

  <description>Hey do you want a 37 minute info dump about digital color? Of course you do.
Topics covered include: Quantization, color banding, dithering, value mapping, palette swapping, radiometry, photometry, how humans perceive color, colorimetry, spectral rendering, the rgb color model, deriving srgb, the hsl color model, gradient mapping, randomly generated color palettes, perceptual color spaces, the lab color model, oklab
tldw: use OKLAB not RGB or HSL. There’s even &#43;oklab()&#43; in CSS now.</description>

  <description>via Aeon.
This video essay traces the history of Kowloon Walled City from its origins as a small 17th-century military outpost to today, where it lives on in the popular imagination through films, video games and an ongoing fascination with this unlikely makeshift society.
The idea of Kowloon fascinates me. Course, by the time I heard of Kowloon it was being torn down. But once you’re aware of it you see it everywhere, used as handy sci-fi metaphor.</description>

  <description>All my tumblelog pages are notes on this blog now. Any time my personal site count goes past 1, the friction ramps up quick. They all end up going a little stale.
So that’s one less site to worry about.</description>

  <description>Bedtime drawing. An hour or so every night or so, for a few months. Helps me wind down from the day.
Usually that’s all it’s for, but my wife liked the finished product. So hey it’s on Design by Hümans if you need a new sweatshirt or something! I did this in Linea Sketch, which has a fixed canvas size. Better start using Procreate or Infinite Painter – and a larger canvas – just in case she wants the next one on a duvet.</description>

  <description>Saw this post today:
{% quote from=&#34;@n4@freeradical.zone&#34; cite=“https://freeradical.zone/@n4/110636140651779144&#34; %}
My greatest advice to those concerned: Start archiving. If you come across something you believe is valuable: make a copy.
If you follow a guide on how to install and configure software and you found it helpful: make a copy.
If you come across a video you really enjoy and find yourself coming back to again and again: make a copy.</description>

<p>My greatest advice to those concerned: Start archiving. If you come across something you believe is valuable: make a copy.</p>
<p>If you follow a guide on how to install and configure software and you found it helpful: make a copy.</p>
<p>If you come across a video you really enjoy and find yourself coming back to again and again: make a copy.</p>
<p>If it means anything to you: make a copy, or you’ll wish you did.
{% /quote %}</p>
<p>That prompted me to quote-share with my own suggestions:</p>
<p>{% quote
from=&quot;@randomgeek@ack.cringe.cafe&rdquo;
%}
Plain old link rot prompted my PKM habits. Twitter, Reddit, etc. are now putting Hanlon’s razor to the test, so it’s a good time to try it yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://capacities.io">Capacities</a> provides excellent link archiving capabilities, but you gotta trust the online-only aspect.</p>
<p>Browser extensions such as <a href="https://github.com/deathau/markdownload">MarkDownload</a> can grab page content to paste into Markdown-friendly note tools like ObsidianMD and Logseq. If you prefer CLI, <a href="https://xwmx.github.io/nb/">nb</a> archives every link you bookmark with it.</p>
<p>Course, in all cases process those notes to the useful bits. Otherwise you’re just data hoarding. Understandable in this Digital Depression, but not helpful.
{% /quote %}</p>
<p>And then it occurred to me. Between budget and attention span constraints, my <a href="https://akkoma.social">Akkoma</a> instance — the one I posted that from — could die at any minute. Maybe I should follow my advice and put that note somewhere more persistent. First my notes, and then this blog.</p>
<p>So there’s my productivity quota for the day more or less complete.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] 2023-10-25
Sure enough I had to take down my Akkoma instance recently for budget prioritization.</p>

  <description>Decentraland as a sad shadow of Second Life. Non-tech folks reporting on it from the perspective of maybe they’re missing something — but there’s nothing to miss. Oh and the wallet-based voting. More committees than a liberal arts college town’s anarchist collective. Ugh.
