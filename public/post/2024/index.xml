  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I changed my blogging workflow — again.</p>
<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<p>I took all my blog posts since 2000 — since before the site was a blog — put them in <a href="/card/obsidian/">Obsidian</a>, extracted note cards for recurring content, and smashed the whole thing into a new iteration of <a href="/card/random-geekery/">Random Geekery</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I tried sharing <a href="/card/my-public-brain/">My Public Brain</a> a couple times. It didn&rsquo;t work out. Maintaining an extra site added personal friction, and I ended up ignoring all of it. I wanted to keep trying, though. My first site <a href="/card/coolnamehere/">coolnamehere</a> was an organized collection of notes on topics as I learned them. I&rsquo;ve mostly been blogging the last decade, but missed the ability to link back to topic notes from my posts.</p>
<p>At the very least, having dedicated topic cards means fewer places to update external links. That can save a few minutes of effort over a couple decades, for sure.</p>
<p>Storing the whole thing in a <a href="/card/pkm/">PKM</a> makes it easier to find mentions and follow cross-references, eventually ensuring some kind of consistency in site structure.</p>
<h2 id="okay-how">Okay, How?</h2>
<h3 id="building-the-vault">Building the vault</h3>
<p>Most of the details and reasoning are over where I describe <a href="/card/how-these-notes-are-organized/">How These Notes are Organized</a>. Basically I have a private folder for new notes, a private folder for journaling, and a private folder for vault templates. Everything else is public.</p>
<p>The process itself was manual:</p>
<ul>
<li>drop all the Markdown from my Hugo site into <a href="/post/">Post</a></li>
<li>arrange posts by year and month so they match permalink expectations, cleaning up and extracting (laughably minimal) new notes for recurring topics as I go; sometimes a post no longer has even personal historical relevance, so I remove it</li>
<li>periodically review those new notes, maybe flesh them out a little bit, and move them to public <a href="/card/">Card</a></li>
<li>Drop in my <a href="/config/">Config</a> files, clean them up a tiny bit, and pinky-promise I&rsquo;ll do more with them later</li>
</ul>
<p>This process of evaluation and refactoring was fundamentally manual, so I limited the plugins to what I needed to mark progress and visually distinguish links.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joethei/obsidian-link-favicon">Link Favicons</a> visually identifies external links</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/swar8080/obsidian-plugin-update-tracker">Plugin Update Tracker</a> so I can keep up with current plugins without extra mental effort</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links">Supercharged Links</a> so I can declare link types for each of my major note sections</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings">Style Settings</a> to define visual design elements for the link types I defined in Supercharged Links</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title">Auto Link Title</a> because sometimes link titles are hard; just use the existing site title and edit if confused</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin">Calendar</a> because it&rsquo;s still a PKM and that means daily journal notes; this plugin makes it easier to get at past journals.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler">Tag Wrangler</a> because I&rsquo;m going to need help cleaning up all those blog post tags</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bkyle/obsidian-vault-statistics-plugin">Vault Statistics</a> to see <del>my score</del> how many pages I have in this vault</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably add plugins later, but the extra functionality of Templater or Dataview would have distracted me from the core task. It happened with previous note consolidation efforts.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-site">Building the site</h3>
<p>Initially I pulled the vault into an <a href="/card/astro/">Astro</a> site with  <a href="https://typestrong.org/ts-node/">ts-node</a>. It sort of worked. Came into some issues with <code>ts-node</code> on very fresh <a href="/card/node.js/">Node.js</a> though, and decided to see if someone had already figured out Obsidian export.</p>
<p>Turns out, yes. <a href="/card/obsidian-export/">obsidian-export</a> handles internal links and provides some starter template logic for working with <a href="/card/hugo/">Hugo</a>. I&rsquo;m setting Astro aside for the moment. Sticking with Hugo made cleanup easier, since I no longer had to care about shortcodes.</p>
<p>Got a Perl script for backlinks and a Python script for processing Obsidian Markdown rules that <code>obsidian-export</code> didn&rsquo;t cover. Not happy with either of those scripts yet, so I won&rsquo;t go into detail about them here. The Perl script finds backlinks and puts them in a data file for quicker backlink handling at site build time, and the Python script currently does some regular expression handling to identify special markup and transform it.</p>
<p>I pulled in my automated tests from the current site iteration. I really should talk more about those tests at some point. They mostly check for structural issues with <code>markdownlint</code> and broken internal links.</p>
<h2 id="what-next">What next</h2>
<p>Budget is constrained, so before the annual hosting bill comes due I&rsquo;ll shift from a paid host to Netlify. My planned usage tier should be free there. I expect to bounce back out again after resolving the current <a href="/card/job-search/">Job Search</a> to my satisfaction, but maybe not. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Before I have the Python script handle all the processing, I&rsquo;ll revisit the Astro iteration. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-obsidian">remark-obsidian</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-definition-list">remark-deflist</a> handled nearly all the special Markdown for me. I mainly need to decide how top-level pages like <a href="/now/">now</a> and <a href="/follow/">follow</a> get treated within Astro&rsquo;s dynamic collection approach.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now</h2>
<p>Hugo works. My current host works. My notes need work, but hey don&rsquo;t we all. I&rsquo;m not going to jiggle anything just yet.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time for <code>just pull backlinks process build test push</code>.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Maybe tighten that invocation up just a little bit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>Mostly working on the brain-blog hybrid.
Jots Almost done with my brain-blog hybrid project, merging My Public Brain with Random Geekery. Made some forward progress on the current Job Search. Nothing concrete yet, but people want to talk to me. That feels nice. Plan shift the live site from blog to brain-blog ever forward with job search Bookmarks A fair bit of Obsidian stuff got my attention this week as I worked out ways to publish the vault within my own very particular workflow.</description>

<p>A fair bit of <a href="/card/obsidian/">Obsidian</a> stuff got my attention this week as I worked out ways to publish the vault within my own very particular workflow. BTW I&rsquo;d just use Obsidian Publish if I wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>

<dd>handy for exporting Obsidian vaults; does not yet handle callouts or YouTube embeds; I ended up settling on <a href="/card/obsidian-export/">obsidian-export</a> + some post-processing for my current publishing workflow</dd>

I want to call them “weekly notes.” I lack confidence in my time awareness, so let’s go with “snapshot.” But hey. I fill up my notes every day. Why not share some of the interesting items here from time to time?
