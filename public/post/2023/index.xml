  <title>Post: Revisiting an old layout</title>

  <description>I’m not saying it’s good. I’m not saying I’ll stick with it. I just wanted to pull solidly away from the utility-class CSS I was using for a while there. Got real hard to tweak.
So for the moment, a slightly tweaked layout I used regularly a couple years ago.</description>

  <description>Hey do you want a 37 minute info dump about digital color? Of course you do.
Topics covered include: Quantization, color banding, dithering, value mapping, palette swapping, radiometry, photometry, how humans perceive color, colorimetry, spectral rendering, the rgb color model, deriving srgb, the hsl color model, gradient mapping, randomly generated color palettes, perceptual color spaces, the lab color model, oklab
tldw: use OKLAB not RGB or HSL. There’s even &#43;oklab()&#43; in CSS now.</description>

  <description>via Aeon.
This video essay traces the history of Kowloon Walled City from its origins as a small 17th-century military outpost to today, where it lives on in the popular imagination through films, video games and an ongoing fascination with this unlikely makeshift society.
The idea of Kowloon fascinates me. Course, by the time I heard of Kowloon it was being torn down. But once you’re aware of it you see it everywhere, used as handy sci-fi metaphor.</description>

  <description>All my tumblelog pages are notes on this blog now. Any time my personal site count goes past 1, the friction ramps up quick. They all end up going a little stale.
So that’s one less site to worry about.</description>

  <description>Bedtime drawing. An hour or so every night or so, for a few months. Helps me wind down from the day.
Usually that’s all it’s for, but my wife liked the finished product. So hey it’s on Design by Hümans if you need a new sweatshirt or something! I did this in Linea Sketch, which has a fixed canvas size. Better start using Procreate or Infinite Painter – and a larger canvas – just in case she wants the next one on a duvet.</description>

  <description>Saw this post today:
My greatest advice to those concerned: Start archiving. If you come across something you believe is valuable: make a copy.
If you follow a guide on how to install and configure software and you found it helpful: make a copy.
If you come across a video you really enjoy and find yourself coming back to again and again: make a copy.
If it means anything to you: make a copy, or you’ll wish you did.</description>

<p>That prompted me to quote-share with my own suggestions:</p>
<figure class="border-primary border-left pl-9 container-9 centered">
  <blockquote
    >
<p>Plain old link rot prompted my PKM habits. Twitter, Reddit, etc. are now putting Hanlon’s razor to the test, so it’s a good time to try it yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://capacities.io">Capacities</a> provides excellent link archiving capabilities, but you gotta trust the online-only aspect.</p>
<p>Browser extensions such as <a href="https://github.com/deathau/markdownload">MarkDownload</a> can grab page content to paste into Markdown-friendly note tools like ObsidianMD and Logseq. If you prefer CLI, <a href="https://xwmx.github.io/nb/">nb</a> archives every link you bookmark with it.</p>
<p>Course, in all cases process those notes to the useful bits. Otherwise you’re just data hoarding. Understandable in this Digital Depression, but not helpful.</p>

<p>And then it occurred to me. Between budget and attention span constraints, my <a href="https://akkoma.social">Akkoma</a> instance — the one I posted that from — could die at any minute. Maybe I should follow my advice and put that note somewhere more persistent. First my notes, and then this blog.</p>
<p>So there’s my productivity quota for the day more or less complete.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2023-10-25</strong></p>
<p>Sure enough I had to take down my Akkoma instance recently for budget prioritization.</p>

  <description>Decentraland as a sad shadow of Second Life. Non-tech folks reporting on it from the perspective of maybe they’re missing something — but there’s nothing to miss. Oh and the wallet-based voting. More committees than a liberal arts college town’s anarchist collective. Ugh.

  <title>Post: Nah on Copilot for now</title>

  <description>GitHub Copilot is a development tool from Microsoft driven by a Large Language Model (LLM) — one piece of the very big tech trend described as “AI”.
Copilot acts as a super-powered autocomplete for developers. Sort of like an LSP, but this goes much further. Where an LSP might give you an identifier or point you to a definition, Copilot generates entire expressions and blocks of code. It assembles reasonable-looking code from what it’s been fed, including your own current projects.</description>

<p>I tried Copilot out, even though I&rsquo;m unhappy about the wholesale appropriation of publicly visible code regardless of license. Ignoring it seemed impractical. What if it really is a game-changer?</p>
<p>After a month? No. Copilot is not a useful tool for me. It&rsquo;s always offering helpful suggestions. Those suggestions are frequently incorrect. Its errors are not always obvious. But it&rsquo;ll keep offering them until you make it stop.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> Copilot would work better if I used fewer languages and experimented with fewer frameworks. As it is, the experience is not unlike pair programming with someone who <em>always</em> tries to paste in the top result from Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some React code!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice, but I&rsquo;m writing an Astro component.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what that algorithm looks like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you! Wait no. This is Python. My code is Nim.</p>
<p>My Copilot trial run has been a month of occasional usefulness in a sea of interruptions just as I was typing something. It changes the game all right. And the new game is &ldquo;let me break your flow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So no. Not for me in its current form.</p>

<p>In fact, ADHD is an invisible disability, which is exactly what it sounds like: “a physical, mental or neurological condition that is not visible from the outside, yet can limit or challenge a person’s movements, senses, or activities” (Invisible Disabilities Association). Plenty of forms of neurodivergence, including autism spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and learning differences can be considered invisible disabilities.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not in-depth or anything, but offers a little pushback to the &ldquo;ADHD is a superpower&rdquo; myth. That myth is handy for the occasional self-help pep talk — &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good enough. I&rsquo;m smart enough. And gosh-darn it, this funky brain wiring is a superpower!&rdquo; — but it&rsquo;s not true. The self-awareness and arsenal of coping techniques like task automation can look impressive to the untrained eye.
Those only give roughly the same functionality as a normal person going about a normal day. And oh goodness if you&rsquo;re in a context where those techniques aren&rsquo;t helpful? You&rsquo;ve got unpartitioned tasks with a poorly defined goal that is important and kinda urgent, but stretched over months?<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The floundering.</p>
