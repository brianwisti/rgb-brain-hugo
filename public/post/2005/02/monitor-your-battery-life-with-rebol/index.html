  <p>One thing you like to keep track of on your laptop is how much juice is left in your battery. There’s nothing quite like being in the middle of some insane hacking session and watching as the computer suddenly gets tired and blacks out on you. Of course, I’ve already got a handy battery monitor in my <a href="https://kde.org">KDE</a> panel, but what if I’m not in KDE? Okay, okay, there are handy battery monitors for nearly every desktop environment out there. That’s not my point, though.
My point is that I’d like to explore some basic system stuff using REBOL on an <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> 8.10 system. Got it? Okay, good. Now that we’ve settled this little detail, let’s move on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>I should mention that if all you want is a command-line printout of your battery information on Linux, you can get that with the command <code>acpi -b</code>. Still, reinventing wheels can be fun. Why not give this a shot?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-raw-materials">The Raw Materials</h2>
<p>Text is like water in UNIX-type systems. It is everywhere, and nearly everything can be accessed as a text file. Linux follows this ideal by keeping system information in a number of files in the <code>/proc/</code> directory. I could probably find everything I might want to know about the system in that directory, but let’s just focus on the directories which contain battery information.</p>
<p>Ubuntu keeps the files in <code>/proc/</code>, but other distros may keep the files in other locations, such as <code>/var/proc/</code>. Poke around on your own system to find out the specifics for your distribution.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0"
    ><code class="language-" data-lang=""
      >&gt;&gt; read %/proc/acpi/battery/
== [%BAT0/]
&gt;&gt; read %/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/
== [%alarm %state %info]</code></pre>
</figure><p>I only have one battery, and this time I only see one folder under <code>/proc/acpi/battery</code>. There were two folders when I ran this on another machine a while back.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0"
    ><code class="language-" data-lang=""
      >&gt;&gt; print read %/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state

present rate:            0 mA
remaining capacity:      4263 mAh
present voltage:         12495 mV</code></pre>
</figure><p>That one battery happens to be fully charged. Good thing, because it’s been sitting plugged in all day. I’m curious. Let’s see what the <code>state</code> file looks like when I unplug the computer.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0"
    ><code class="language-" data-lang=""
      >&gt;&gt; print read %/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state

present rate:            0 mA
remaining capacity:      4341 mAh
present voltage:         12107 mV</code></pre>
</figure><p>Okay, so it is pretty easy to tell when your computer is plugged in and when it isn’t. The <code>info</code> file contains some more useful information about the battery which will come in handy later on.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0"
    ><code class="language-" data-lang=""

</figure><p>What about the <code>alarm</code> file?</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0"
    ><code class="language-" data-lang=""
      >&gt;&gt; print read %/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/alarm
alarm:                   unsupported</code></pre>
</figure><p>Oh well, I wasn’t really sure what I’d do with that information anyhow.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen what the raw information looks like, let’s work on making a useful utility which processes that information.</p>

</figure><p>We need that <code>-s</code> command line parameter in there if we want to run this script peacefully. What happens if we don’t? Every time we run the script, REBOL throws a little dialog asking us if we’re sure we want this script touching our precious files. All in all, a good thing to do, but we <em>know</em> we are okay with this script reading our files, precious or otherwise.</p>
<p>Right. We are looking for every battery directory, and printing out its <code>state</code>. What does that look like? Not much, right now.</p>

</figure><p>It’s time to start looking at REBOL’s <code>parse</code> rules.</p>
<p>Tell me not to be scared.</p>
<h3 id="playing-at-parse">Playing at Parse</h3>
<p>Each item is on one line. The key is on the left side, then there’s a colon and some whitespace before reaching the actual value. I’d like to get at the information in this file as a hash: a dictionary datatype where values on the right are tied to keys on the left. Let’s use Parse and split along the colon character, like so.</p>

<p>I’ll come back to that issue after I’ve learned a little bit more about Parse. For now, let’s focus on the fact that we are finally getting to the data. That means we have reached a milestone, and it also means we can stretch our legs for a minute.
Good circulation is important, after all. Let’s refactor before we move on. I like to have my code as clean as I know how to make it each step of the way.</p>

</figure><p>You aren’t supposed to change the actual functionality during refactoring, because the whole idea is to make it do exactly the same thing it did before, but in a more sane style.

<p>Now let’s take this raw data and turn it into output that I can actually do something with. To do that, we need to decide what information we care about and what we don’t.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t care about batteries I don’t have. Don’t show them to me.</li>
<li>I care about whether the computer is plugged in or not.</li>
<li>I can’t convert remaining capacity of total capacity in my head. Just show me a percentage remaining.</li>
<li>I <em>certainly</em> can’t convert present rate and remaining capacity. Show me a time value instead.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dont-show-batteries-i-dont-have">Don’t Show Batteries I Don’t Have</h4>
<p>This should be the easiest step. All we need to do is check the value of the &ldquo;present&rdquo; key. Should be no problem at all.</p>

<h4 id="show-me-percentage-of-remaining-battery-capacity">Show Me Percentage Of Remaining Battery Capacity</h4>
<p>I will want to know how much power is remaining if the battery is either &ldquo;charging&rdquo; or &ldquo;discharging&rdquo;. I don’t know what <code>mAh</code> is – <em>milliAmp-hours?</em>. I prefer to see this in terms of what percentage is remaining. A full battery has 100%, and an empty battery has 0%. Seems easy enough, but we don’t have the total capacity listed in the state file. To get this information, we will need to look at the <code>info</code> file.</p>
<figure class="highlight">

</figure><p>Yes, that’s the output that I want, but the code is turning into something … <em>evil</em>. Or at least something <em>ugly</em>. I should consider refactoring again before I move on to the next step. I will just show you the end result of the refactoring, but these are the ideas that guided me as I looked at my code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go ahead and read all the data files. It’s not like memory is an issue for an app like this.
<ul>
<li>Don’t forget to look for duplicate keys when assembling the hash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove duplication where possible.</li>
<li>Only use <code>print</code> once for each battery. Narrowing down the sources of output can make debugging and reading easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s the refactoring.</p>

</figure><p>Wow, I really don’t know what those numbers mean. We could fake it until we get a result that looks like what I see when I scrub the mouse over my KDE battery applet. I think I will do a little bit of searching on the Web, though. There is probably some sort of reference to the ACPI state files.</p>
<p>I have a rule not to spend more than fifteen minutes looking something up online, unless the end result of such a search would be money or finding something that pleases my wife. This is neither, and I’ve just spent fifteen minutes making a few clumsy stabs at finding a reference for the ACPI state file. No luck, so let’s go with the faking it.</p>
<p>The KDE panel says I have a little over two hours left on my laptop. With a couple of quick hacks, my script more or less agrees with KDE. There’s an occasional difference of a minute or two, but that is not an urgent issue for something like this. I would be much more concerned if this script was going to be used in a production environment, or in an environment where being off by a couple of seconds could cost somebody their life. On the other hand, what are they doing using some script they cobbled off the Web to keep their loved ones alive? And then they’ll probably get mad at <em>me</em> when it goes wrong. I swear, some people are just too strange for words.</p>
<p>What? Oh, right. Here’s the finished version of the utility. Took me a couple of hours, but a lot of that was me learning the basics of <code>parse</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if I wanted to make this readily accessible from the command line, which I do, then I would just copy <code>laptop.r</code> to someplace on my path. I might even rename to something like <code>check-battery</code> without the &ldquo;.r&rdquo; suffix, to make it look more like any old command. This is a common maneuver on the command line. Many of the commands you use every day in the shell are just thinly disguised scripts, written in one language or another.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project was an exercise to see how difficult it would be to create a relatively simple utility. It was a challenge until I started getting the hang of Parse. I think Parse is easier to understand than regular expressions, but regular expressions have the advantage that they are familiar to more Linux developers. Still - get Parse out of the way, and creating useful applications in REBOL suddenly becomes very easy.</p>
<h3 id="additional-ideas">Additional Ideas</h3>
<p>There are a number of different things you could do to enhance or refine this script. Here are a couple of ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>This script is <em>not</em> portable. It assumes that you have the same file setup as my HP notebook running me version of Ubuntu. Any differences brought on by different distributions or operating systems are unaccounted for. You might want to alter the script to look in the right places for your machine.</li>
<li>The script is <em>not</em> robust. What happens if there’s a zero in the wrong place, or ACPI can’t figure out what the rate of discharge is? I don’t know, but it’s probably not something good. You might want to make it more robust by checking for possible errors.</li>
<li>Hey, what about writing this as a View application? Yeah, you could make a cute little picture of a battery that empties out as the remaining power drops. Why stop there? You could implement a whole system monitor, like <a href="http://gkrellm.net/">gkrellm</a>. That might be fun.</li>
</ul>
