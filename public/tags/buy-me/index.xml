Okay I’ve had one for a while. But I put something on it.
Buy a mug. A phone case. A backpack. A credenza?! YES!
Collect them all!
Incidentally, there appears to be a sale going on now. Discounts on everything.
Even the credenza.</description>

<p>I feel like I neglected the blog this year. That&rsquo;s probably because of the half dozen draft posts I still need to finish. Also, I&rsquo;ve been busy working, drawing, learning, and even — <em>gasp</em> — socializing!</p>
<p>One of the big moments for me? Well, aside from dancing in public, which I hadn&rsquo;t done in well over a decade? The purchase of a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Refurbished, because if I can save a few bucks I will. Drawing on it is a delight, pretty much. Not <em>quite</em> as smooth as iPad + Pencil, but far better than using a capacitive stylus on other phones. Overall, the Note takes me back to the days of having a small sketchbook with me at all times.</p>
<p>The Note is Android, which means I could install <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> on it and grab a <a href="/post/2019/01/circular-grids-with-python-and-pillow/">circle template</a> from my desktop. My first serious sketch with the Note was of course another manual symmetry doodle.</p>
<p>The Note&rsquo;s specs meant that I could have many layers for relatively large images (this one is 4084x4084 pixels) and still get a smooth drawing experience. I like the end result, too.</p>
<p>I kind of want to take a break from the super detailed symmetry drawings,  though. Seems like that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been doing lately! Maybe practice some cartoon style doodles. Pull out the Mark Kistler books if I have to.</p>
<p>Oh, and I should finish those draft posts at some point.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href=&#34;https://randomgeekery.org/post/2019/01/circular-grids-with-python-and-pillow/&#34;&gt;circle template&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned a couple weeks ago? Well, I made it so I could draw stuff like this!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Spent about a month on it, an hour or so at a time. Will I do it again? Of course! Will I do it regularly? Who knows? It took more patience than I&rsquo;m used to, and I still haven&rsquo;t decided how much I like it.</p>
<p>I enjoyed figuring out the templates with code and then building on them manually. I also have ideas for some Celtic style images.</p>
<p>But first I need to get back to preparing a work talk.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I found a quick symmetry doodle in Sketchbook from a month or two ago, turned off symmetry, then spent about a week and a half reworking the lines and adding &ldquo;just one more bit.&rdquo; Switch over to Procreate for a couple hours of touchups, because I prefer the feel of Procreate&rsquo;s brushes.</p>
<p>Finally forced myself to stop and post this. It is too easy to keep going until you lose steam and end up with an overwhelmingly intricate but <em>unfinished</em> work.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah I switched the theme back — with some changes. May take a bit for the CDN to catch up. Also still experimenting with how to organize things I want to sell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>For the moment, pieces are shown on the front page. I&rsquo;ll put a proper section up once I know what I want it to look like.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see my own take on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://norse-mythology.org/vegvisir/&#34;&gt;Vegvísir&lt;/a&gt;, an Icelandic symbol also called a “Nordic Compass”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to see my own take on the <a href="https://norse-mythology.org/vegvisir/">Vegvísir</a>, an Icelandic symbol also called a &ldquo;Nordic Compass&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After a <em>lot</em> of work my favorite part was the underlying rough line work. So I kept that and scrapped the rest.</p>
<p>I will probably make more attempts drawing this symbol. Read up on it studying mythology, folklore, and symbolism when I was a kid, then forgot about it until it started cropping up in my life recently. This will do for a start though.</p>
<p>All I know for sure about the Vegvísir is this description from the 19th Century <a href="https://www.academia.edu/13008560/Huld_Manuscript_of_Galdrastafir_Witchcraft_Magic_Symbols_and_Runes_-_English_Translation">Huld manuscript</a>.</p>

  <description>I opened a store on the Design by Hümans site! I also made card/Hugo warn me when I forget purchase links.
Well, one design. I only got things going yesterday, with a quick sketch on a plain white background. Future plans include adjusting old designs and creating new ones for the store, with an intended pace of roughly one design per week.
Of course I already worked out the site integration.</description>

<p>Of course I already worked out the site integration. Everything on Random Geekery tagged &ldquo;buy me&rdquo; should have a direct link to its page on the store. I get a lovely Hugo <a href="http://gohugo.io/functions/errorf/"><code>errorf</code></a> message if I forget the link.</p>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;I was so unhappy with my attempts to draw realistic pictures of my friend Rainy that I went in the complete opposite direction and drew her in sort of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibi_%28term%29&#34;&gt;chibi&lt;/a&gt; style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This was the starting photo, if you’re curious.</p>

<p>I liked Chibi Rainy enough that I made a small order from <a href="https://www.stickermule.com/">Sticker Mule</a>.</p>

<p>Of course Rainy gets the place of prominence on my computer.</p>

<p>Most of the stickers were given to her friends, who put them in all sorts of interesting places. Restaurants, guitars, and random walls. I’ll post a few of them when I have a little more time.</p>]]></content:encoded>
