  <description>Somebody scraped the “lives” part off “sweep leaves not lives”
Seattle’s homeless sweeps are contentious to say the least.
From The Seattle Times, on July 9th:
Seattle removed 75% more homeless encampments in the first four months of this year than during the same period in 2018, even with this February’s record snowstorm slowing clean-ups.
John Curley pointed out the NIMBY — “Not In My Backyard” — aspect:
What they’re doing is they’re trying to push them out of view.</description>

Somebody scraped the &ldquo;lives&rdquo; part off &ldquo;sweep leaves not lives&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seattle&rsquo;s homeless sweeps are contentious to say the least.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/on-way-to-long-term-changes-seattle-mayor-jenny-durkan-quietly-clears-homeless-camps/">The Seattle Times</a>, on July 9th:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><a href="https://mynorthwest.com/1445501/seattle-homeless-sweeps-2019/">John Curley</a> pointed out the NIMBY — &ldquo;Not In My Backyard&rdquo; — aspect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What they’re doing is they’re trying to push them out of view. So they’re sending them back behind railroad tracks, back behind buildings, back away from the general view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mostly I&rsquo;m curious who&rsquo;d be so offended by this wall art that they&rsquo;d remove part of its message.</p>
