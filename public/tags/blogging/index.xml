  <title>Post: The Memex Method Works For Me</title>

  <description>The genius of the blog was not in the note-taking, it was in the publishing. The act of making your log-file public requires a rigor that keeping personal notes does not.
– Cory Doctorow, The Memex Method
Even my little personal blog forces a helpful layer of structure compared to my regular thinking.</description>

  <title>Post: SSG is for putterers</title>

  <description>Kev Quirk on static site generators — WordPress Creator Vs The Jamstack (2020-05-20)
SSGs are really cool and super fun to play with – I’m really enjoying it on my side project; but I wish a lot of devs would stop touting about how amazingly simple they are, as it’s just not the case.
I often see “such and such card/Static Site Generator is simple!” tweets, and wonder what exactly they’re comparing it to.</description>

<p>I often see &ldquo;such and such <a href="/card/static-site-generator/">card/Static Site Generator</a> is simple!&rdquo; tweets, and wonder what exactly they&rsquo;re comparing it to. DIY dentistry perhaps?</p>
<p>As much as I love puttering with static site generators, &ldquo;puttering&rdquo; is the main charm of an SSG. The hooks to customize are right there on the surface. Heck <a href="/card/eleventy/">Eleventy</a> is nothing <em>but</em> hooks. And having everything in a git repository is just a developer-focused version of a smart backup plan.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> side of things, I&rsquo;m not sure I see the advantage of relying on a load of external services over oh say for example having a database and an internal comment system. You know, like Wordpress. Something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot in relation to my own site leaning so much on <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a>.</p>

Skimming through my fraidyc.at updates and oh hey! Something from john sj anderson!
meta-post:
friend of the blog brian wisti had a great post about adding h-entry microformats on his blog, which led to me adding some h-entry stuff here too.
My words helped make something better!</description>

  <title>Post: Be proud of your blog site thing</title>

  <description>From Happy 20th to This Blog!:
It‘s tempting to think that The Thing of my career has been NetNewsWire. And that’s kinda true. But the thing I’ve done the longest, love the most, and am most proud of is this blog.
This Brent Simmons post is going around a lot in my RSS feed. Probably because many of us feel similar — or want to.
It took me a long time to admit that my site was a blog.</description>

<p>This <a href="https://inessential.com/">Brent Simmons</a> post is going around a lot in my RSS feed. Probably because many of us feel similar — or want to.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to admit that my site was a blog. I disliked the word and aspired to be more like the sprawling mass of <a href="http://softpanorama.org/">Softpanorama</a>. <em>Content</em> not a mere stream of distractions. This was before <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=seattle%20weather%20update%20from%3Abrianwisti%20&amp;src=typed_query">Twitter</a>, mind you.</p>
<p>Eventually I settled down. Time is a factor for all content.</p>
<p>And if I was starting today I doubt Softpanorama would be my target. Maybe <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah like I could ever be that focused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of my blog site thing. I&rsquo;ve made friends through it. I&rsquo;ve lost a couple. It&rsquo;s all over the place, but very much represents the changes and consistencies in who I&rsquo;ve been the last couple decades.</p>
<p>Start your own blog site thing if you haven&rsquo;t already. Have fun!</p>
