  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I changed my blogging workflow — again.</p>
<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<p>I took all my blog posts since 2000 — since before the site was a blog — put them in <a href="/card/obsidian/">Obsidian</a>, extracted note cards for recurring content, and smashed the whole thing into a new iteration of <a href="/card/random-geekery/">Random Geekery</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I tried sharing <a href="/card/my-public-brain/">My Public Brain</a> a couple times. It didn&rsquo;t work out. Maintaining an extra site added personal friction, and I ended up ignoring all of it. I wanted to keep trying, though. My first site <a href="/card/coolnamehere/">coolnamehere</a> was an organized collection of notes on topics as I learned them. I&rsquo;ve mostly been blogging the last decade, but missed the ability to link back to topic notes from my posts.</p>
<p>At the very least, having dedicated topic cards means fewer places to update external links. That can save a few minutes of effort over a couple decades, for sure.</p>
<p>Storing the whole thing in a <a href="/card/pkm/">PKM</a> makes it easier to find mentions and follow cross-references, eventually ensuring some kind of consistency in site structure.</p>
<h2 id="okay-how">Okay, How?</h2>
<h3 id="building-the-vault">Building the vault</h3>
<p>Most of the details and reasoning are over where I describe <a href="/card/how-these-notes-are-organized/">How These Notes are Organized</a>. Basically I have a private folder for new notes, a private folder for journaling, and a private folder for vault templates. Everything else is public.</p>
<p>The process itself was manual:</p>
<ul>
<li>drop all the Markdown from my Hugo site into <a href="/post/">Post</a></li>
<li>arrange posts by year and month so they match permalink expectations, cleaning up and extracting (laughably minimal) new notes for recurring topics as I go; sometimes a post no longer has even personal historical relevance, so I remove it</li>
<li>periodically review those new notes, maybe flesh them out a little bit, and move them to public <a href="/card/">Card</a></li>
<li>Drop in my <a href="/config/">Config</a> files, clean them up a tiny bit, and pinky-promise I&rsquo;ll do more with them later</li>
</ul>
<p>This process of evaluation and refactoring was fundamentally manual, so I limited the plugins to what I needed to mark progress and visually distinguish links.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joethei/obsidian-link-favicon">Link Favicons</a> visually identifies external links</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/swar8080/obsidian-plugin-update-tracker">Plugin Update Tracker</a> so I can keep up with current plugins without extra mental effort</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links">Supercharged Links</a> so I can declare link types for each of my major note sections</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings">Style Settings</a> to define visual design elements for the link types I defined in Supercharged Links</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title">Auto Link Title</a> because sometimes link titles are hard; just use the existing site title and edit if confused</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin">Calendar</a> because it&rsquo;s still a PKM and that means daily journal notes; this plugin makes it easier to get at past journals.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler">Tag Wrangler</a> because I&rsquo;m going to need help cleaning up all those blog post tags</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bkyle/obsidian-vault-statistics-plugin">Vault Statistics</a> to see <del>my score</del> how many pages I have in this vault</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably add plugins later, but the extra functionality of Templater or Dataview would have distracted me from the core task. It happened with previous note consolidation efforts.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-site">Building the site</h3>
<p>Initially I pulled the vault into an <a href="/card/astro/">Astro</a> site with  <a href="https://typestrong.org/ts-node/">ts-node</a>. It sort of worked. Came into some issues with <code>ts-node</code> on very fresh <a href="/card/node.js/">Node.js</a> though, and decided to see if someone had already figured out Obsidian export.</p>
<p>Turns out, yes. <a href="/card/obsidian-export/">obsidian-export</a> handles internal links and provides some starter template logic for working with <a href="/card/hugo/">Hugo</a>. I&rsquo;m setting Astro aside for the moment. Sticking with Hugo made cleanup easier, since I no longer had to care about shortcodes.</p>
<p>Got a Perl script for backlinks and a Python script for processing Obsidian Markdown rules that <code>obsidian-export</code> didn&rsquo;t cover. Not happy with either of those scripts yet, so I won&rsquo;t go into detail about them here. The Perl script finds backlinks and puts them in a data file for quicker backlink handling at site build time, and the Python script currently does some regular expression handling to identify special markup and transform it.</p>
<p>I pulled in my automated tests from the current site iteration. I really should talk more about those tests at some point. They mostly check for structural issues with <code>markdownlint</code> and broken internal links.</p>
<h2 id="what-next">What next</h2>
<p>Budget is constrained, so before the annual hosting bill comes due I&rsquo;ll shift from a paid host to Netlify. My planned usage tier should be free there. I expect to bounce back out again after resolving the current <a href="/card/job-search/">Job Search</a> to my satisfaction, but maybe not. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Before I have the Python script handle all the processing, I&rsquo;ll revisit the Astro iteration. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-obsidian">remark-obsidian</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-definition-list">remark-deflist</a> handled nearly all the special Markdown for me. I mainly need to decide how top-level pages like <a href="/now/">now</a> and <a href="/follow/">follow</a> get treated within Astro&rsquo;s dynamic collection approach.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now</h2>
<p>Hugo works. My current host works. My notes need work, but hey don&rsquo;t we all. I&rsquo;m not going to jiggle anything just yet.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time for <code>just pull backlinks process build test push</code>.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Maybe tighten that invocation up just a little bit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>I’m not saying it’s good. I’m not saying I’ll stick with it. I just wanted to pull solidly away from the utility-class CSS I was using for a while there. Got real hard to tweak.
So for the moment, a slightly tweaked layout I used regularly a couple years ago.</description>

  <description>All my tumblelog pages are notes on this blog now. Any time my personal site count goes past 1, the friction ramps up quick. They all end up going a little stale.
So that’s one less site to worry about.</description>

Okay it’s JavaScript-powered. If you don’t have JS you won’t even see the search bar. Besides that Pagefind is pretty darn good! I can put off organizing the site a little longer.</description>

  <description>tldr:
add TITLE: bundle exec ruby _scripts/add-post --title &#39;{{ TITLE }}&#39; Time to fiddle with my site setup some more.
My site posts are organized by file slug: simplified file paths based on a title. Hugo itself directly supports creating new content by path.
hugo new content/post/2022/testing-justfile-recipe-arguments/index.adoc.txt It takes thinking to map from a title to a slug. Sometimes I’m not in the mood for that kind of thinking. And I’m not always great about consistency in my slug choices.</description>

</figure><p>Time to fiddle with my site setup some more.</p>
<p>My site posts are organized by file slug: simplified file paths based on a title. <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> itself directly supports creating new content by path.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"
    ><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo new content/post/2022/testing-justfile-recipe-arguments/index.adoc.txt</span></span></code></pre>
</figure><p>It takes thinking to map from a title to a slug. Sometimes I&rsquo;m not in the mood for that kind of thinking. And I&rsquo;m not always great about consistency in my slug choices.</p>
<p>So I use a <a href="https://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> script to streamline adding new posts. I won&rsquo;t talk about that today. Maybe another day. All it does is use <a href="https://ttytoolkit.org">TTY::Toolkit</a> to save me a couple seconds of thought compared to <code>hugo new</code>, then fires up <code>$EDITOR</code> for me so I don&rsquo;t have to think about that either. Sometimes two seconds is the difference between writing an impulse post and writing a tweet.</p>
<p>Right now the script needs a <code>--title</code> string it can use for frontmatter and file slug.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"
    ><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">bundle <span class="nb">exec</span> ruby _scripts/add-post --title <span class="s1">&#39;Testing Justfile Recipe Arguments&#39;</span></span></span></code></pre>
</figure><p>I don&rsquo;t have to figure out the slug, but it&rsquo;s still rather tedious. I use <a href="https://just.systems">just</a> to simplify those tedious site tasks. Putting the repeated bits of this invocation in a recipe — that&rsquo;s what <code>just</code> calls tasks — would cut down on the tedium. What about the title? Started thinking about TTY::Toolkit interactive prompts. Maybe some other time, because <code>just</code> lets you specify arguments for a recipe.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"
    ><code class="language-justfile" data-lang="justfile"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nf">add TITLE</span><span class="o">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  bundle <span class="nb">exec</span> ruby _scripts/add-post --title <span class="s1">&#39;{{ TITLE }}&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
</figure><p>Now I can <code>just add</code> a post.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"
    ><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">just add <span class="s1">&#39;Testing Justfile Recipe Arguments&#39;</span></span></span></code></pre>
</figure><p>And here we are!</p>
<p>I use a couple other Ruby scripts. Might as well refactor that <code>bundle exec ruby</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
  <pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"
    ><code class="language-justfile" data-lang="justfile"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">ruby</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;bundle exec ruby&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nf">add TITLE</span><span class="o">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="o">{{</span> ruby <span class="o">}}</span> _scripts/add-post --title <span class="s1">&#39;{{ TITLE }}&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
</figure><p>All right. This is better than what I had before. Sure I&rsquo;ve got multiple helpful layers to track now. That&rsquo;ll bite me if I get carried away. On the other hand, I actually wrote something for the site today.</p>
<p>Sometimes two seconds makes the difference.</p>

  <description>Jack wonders when dinner is
The toilet fire that is Twitter’s new management strategy continues apace. Felt compelled to take my normally wide-open account and lock it. I don’t want to deactivate and delete. Somebody else can come along, grab the name, and spam the hell out of people with it.
But hey, where else can you find me? I’ll update my h-card once the dust settles, but here’s where I’m at roughly in order of how much attention I’ve given it:</description>

<p>Meanwhile I&rsquo;m pondering the plausibility of a single-user <a href="https://fediverse.party">Fediverse</a> instance as a way to enable comments. Or I could just set up a WordPress site. Until I decide on that, you can find me at one or more of the listed sites.</p>
<p>And all this is kinda depressing after 15 years on Twitter. Okay yes I hated it half the time but that uh that came from a place of love. But anyways enough gloominess. How about a picture of one of the cats?</p>

  <description>Lots of Elon Musk madness going on at Twitter. From a Platformer summary of the last day or two.
…as Platformer was first to report, its chief privacy officer, Damien Kieran; its chief information security officer; Lea Kissner; and its chief compliance officer, Marianne Fogarty, had all resigned…So did John Debay, director of software engineering…much of the security governance risks and compliance team has left…
This is on top of all the folks Musk fired or who have resigned in the week since he took over.</description>

  <description>So anyways yeah. Site’s built with card/Hugo again. This iteration is relatively minimal: let Hugo be Hugo with Markdown, render hooks, and shortcodes. A justfile. Some Python for preprocessing and tests. Right, and markdownlint-cli. I’d love to do posts about some or all of the pieces.
Notes and bookmarks got merged into the main post stream. Internal links are clean, but no promises yet about links from the outside world. That’s a pretty big shuffle I just did.</description>

<p>Yeah. One of our kitties — Jack — has been having trouble keeping his food down for a few days. We had better luck with soft food today, but he still threw up a little.

  <description>Made a toot with Masto. Kinda need that for content syndication.
Here&#39;s my toot
The Mastodon Twitter Crossposter works great, but waiting for the announcement toot to show up as a tweet was a tedious manual step that I hope to discard. So I figured out how to make a tweet with twitter-api-v2.
Those are the pieces I need to get POSSE syndication working in this card/Eleventy iteration of the site.</description>
