  <description>Blog post pending. But yeah. markdown-it-py preprocessing Markdown content for my card/Hugo site.
Why?
I don’t understand the question. To find out if I can, I guess?
Working well enough that I added another Neovim remote plugin to handle the task.</description>

  <description>Kev Quirk on static site generators — WordPress Creator Vs The Jamstack (2020-05-20)
SSGs are really cool and super fun to play with – I’m really enjoying it on my side project; but I wish a lot of devs would stop touting about how amazingly simple they are, as it’s just not the case.
I often see “such and such card/Static Site Generator is simple!” tweets, and wonder what exactly they’re comparing it to.</description>

<p>I often see &ldquo;such and such <a href="/card/static-site-generator/">card/Static Site Generator</a> is simple!&rdquo; tweets, and wonder what exactly they&rsquo;re comparing it to. DIY dentistry perhaps?</p>
<p>As much as I love puttering with static site generators, &ldquo;puttering&rdquo; is the main charm of an SSG. The hooks to customize are right there on the surface. Heck <a href="/card/eleventy/">Eleventy</a> is nothing <em>but</em> hooks. And having everything in a git repository is just a developer-focused version of a smart backup plan.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> side of things, I&rsquo;m not sure I see the advantage of relying on a load of external services over oh say for example having a database and an internal comment system. You know, like Wordpress. Something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot in relation to my own site leaning so much on <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a>.</p>
