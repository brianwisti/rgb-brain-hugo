  <title>Post: Not sure why I keep fussing with every single SSG. It&#39;s fun, I guess?</title>

  <description>So after bouncing back to card/Hugo from a brief card/Statamic experiment, what do I do? Do I post the slides from a talk I gave the other day, like I promised?
No of course not.
I spent the weekend messing with Nanoc and Nikola. Still chasing the high of the perfect site generator? Maybe.
Nikolaâ€™s got the convenience thing down. Someone can sit and start a fresh blog quick.</description>

<p>So after bouncing back to <a href="/card/hugo/">card/Hugo</a> from a brief <a href="/card/statamic/">card/Statamic</a> experiment, what do I do? Do I post the slides from a talk I gave the other day, like I promised?</p>
<p>No of course not.</p>
<p>I spent the weekend messing with <a href="https://nanoc.app">Nanoc</a> and <a href="https://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>. Still chasing the high of the perfect site generator? Maybe.</p>
<p>Nikola&rsquo;s got the convenience thing down. Someone can sit and start a fresh blog quick.</p>
<p>Nanoc&rsquo;s got this sort of friendly flexibility. It&rsquo;s been able to handle every idea so far. Obviously not nearly as fast as Hugo, but fast enough if you don&rsquo;t get carried away with images and templates.</p>
<p>Guess what I like to do. I like to get carried away with images and templates.</p>
<p>Might play more with Nanoc. Might get back to tuning the Hugo site.</p>
<p>Been sort of eyeballing <a href="https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/">Elder.js</a> and <a href="https://vitepress.vuejs.org/">Vitepress</a> too. Sort-of-static sounds like fun.</p>
