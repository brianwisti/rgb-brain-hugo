  <description>Finished knitting a nice winter hat for the Missus. Right in time for summer. But at least she got a couple days where it was cool enough to wear the hat without sweating to death.</description>

  <title>Post: Basic Hat With Picot Edge</title>

  <description>This hat is another round of the “basic hat” from Ann Budd’s The Knitter’s Handy Book of Patterns. This time I used a picot edge, which adds texture to the hemmed edge from last time.
The picot edge was so satisfying that I decided to add a couple more new techniques. First was the Roman stitch on the hat body, which came from A Treasury of Knitting Patterns. The pattern instructions from the book are for knitting flat.</description>

<p>This hat is another round of the &ldquo;basic hat&rdquo; from Ann Budd’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85015.Knitters_Handy_Book_Of_Patterns">The Knitter’s Handy Book of Patterns</a>. This time I used a picot edge, which adds texture to the hemmed edge from <a href="/post/2018/11/basic-hat-with-hemmed-edge/">last time</a>.</p>
<p>The picot edge was so satisfying that I decided to add a couple more new techniques. First was the Roman stitch on the hat body, which came from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129506.A_Treasury_of_Knitting_Patterns">A Treasury of Knitting Patterns</a>. The pattern instructions from the book are for knitting flat. I adapted them for knitting in the round.</p>

</dl>
<p>I wasn’t done with new stuff, though. I decided it was time for my first pom pom. Wandered off to YouTube to see the process in action.</p>
<p>I needed to see someone making a pom pom.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ilFeg7dPIU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Finally, I realized I also needed to see someone attach a pom pom to a hat. The hat in the video is crochet, but the principle is the same.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aiRQb5JkjzE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>After all that, the hat came out quite nice. It fit my head comfortably. The pom pom stays securely attached. The Roman Stitch feels nice when I rub my hands on the hat.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018/11/attachments/img/2018/modeling.jpg" alt="A much better fit"/></p>
<p>So naturally I’m taking the hat down to the post office tomorrow to ship off for a friend. Their head has the same circumference as mine. At this point, I worry less about the fate of my projects. I can make more.</p>

  <description>Ann Budd’s book The Knitter’s Handy Book of Patterns continues to teach me new techniques. This project is my second iteration of her “Basic hat” template. The black wool hat I made a couple of weeks ago was the first.
What’s the difference? The wool hat — and most of the hats I have knitted until now — had a ribbed edge. Alternating knit and purl stitches create a section more elastic than the body of the hat, so it hugs a bit closer to your head.</description>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I made another hat! This time I learned how to make a hemmed edge.</h2><p><img src="/post/2018/11/../../../attachments/img/2018/cover-2018-11-11.jpg" alt="attachments/img/2018/cover-2018-11-11.jpg"/></p>
<p>Ann Budd’s book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85015.Knitters_Handy_Book_Of_Patterns">The Knitter’s Handy Book of Patterns</a> continues to teach me new techniques. This project is my second iteration of her &ldquo;Basic hat&rdquo; template. The black <a href="/post/2018/10/winter-hat-and-gloves/">wool hat</a> I made a couple of weeks ago was the first.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? The wool hat — and most of the hats I have knitted until now — had a <a href="https://www.dummies.com/crafts/knitting/knitting-stitches/how-to-rib-stitch/">ribbed</a> edge. Alternating knit and purl stitches create a section more elastic than the body of the hat, so it hugs a bit closer to your head.</p>
<p>This hat uses a <a href="http://www.vogueknitting.com/pattern_help/how-to/beyond_the_basics/hems">hemmed</a> edge. Stockinette rows get folded over and stitched into the body of the hat. I like the smooth look a hemmed edge produces. The extra volume of the hem provides the snugness needed to keep your hat on your head.</p>
<p>Oh! This was also the first time I used my copy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13167139-the-handknitter-s-yarn-guide">The Handknitter’s Yarn Guide</a>! See, I had this mystery yarn in my stash. It was thick and self-striping, but that’s all I knew. No idea about the material, or what size needles I should be using. And let’s be honest, &ldquo;thick yarn&rdquo; is more than a little subjective. Some people <a href="https://youtu.be/FKw-pjwaXz8">knit with rope</a>, after all.</p>
<p>The Yarn Guide provides a reference of yarn textures and varieties, focused on details that are important for hand knitters. Machine knitters track somewhat different details. It includes nifty details like how a particular yarn material feels, or how it should burn — wool burns slow, acrylic goes up quick. It also describes <a href="https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/how-measure-wraps-inch-wpi">wraps per inch</a> for establishing the weight of your yarn. &ldquo;Weight&rdquo; here is not about mass and gravity, but about expected gauge and needle size.</p>
<p>My 200 gram chunk of mystery self-striping yarn yielded eight and a half wraps per inch. A snip burned <em>quick</em>. This suggested I had a bulky acrylic, and should use size 13-15 (9-10mm) knitting needles.</p>
<p>Except I misread those numbers — three cheers for minor cognitive issues! — and ended up using size 9 (5.5mm) needles. Combine that with the fact that my flat knitting — such as what I used for the gauge swatch — produces a wildly different gauge from my knitting in the round, and. Well.</p>
<p>I made a <em>lovely</em> hat. A hat that was maybe a little too snug for a comfortable fit on my head.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018/11/attachments/img/2018/wearing-hat.jpg" title="The hat looks nice, but after a minute starts pinching my forehead" alt="me wearing the hat"/></p>
<p>That’s okay though. The hat fits a friend perfectly, and it’s heading home with them as I type.</p>
<p>For future projects, I will make my flat stockinette stitch match my round knitting gauge more closely. The main difference is in my purl stitch, which is looser than my knit stitch unless I pay close attention. When you knit in the round, purl stitches occur less often than when flat. That’s why those projects have a tighter gauge and tighter fit.</p>
<p>So far the hat I am knitting now has only a somewhat tighter gauge than the flat swatch. I <em>could</em> — maybe &ldquo;should?&rdquo; — also knit my gauge swatch in the round, but I’m not entirely confident that a gauge tube is what I need. We’ll see. But so far the current hat is the size I expected. That’s good enough for me.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I made  myself a hat and gloves in matching colors for winter.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018/10/../../../attachments/img/2018/cover-2018-10-27.jpg" alt="attachments/img/2018/cover-2018-10-27.jpg"/></p>
<p>The gloves use the same <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170305.Son_of_Stitch_n_Bitch">Son of Stitch &rsquo;n Bitch</a> pattern as the <a href="/post/2018/08/beer-gloves/">purple beer gloves</a> I knitted this summer. This pair turned out much better. Learning through repetition! However, that Loops &amp; Threads &ldquo;Impeccable&rdquo; yarn is far too stiff for gloves. I would prefer a sportweight blend to this worsted weight acrylic for things that need to move with my hands.</p>
<p>I lost the label for the hat yarn but it&rsquo;s probably Patons North America Classic Wool Worsted. So soft and cozy on my head. I accidentally changed tension once I picked up speed, resulting in an interesting gauge effect along the bottom ribbing, but that is already becoming less pronounced with wear. You can also see twisted stiches where I recovered a row but mounted those stitches incorrectly. This happened plenty of times in the past, but I wanted to remember these little mistakes for future projects.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t me being overly fussy. It&rsquo;s just me moving past the beginner mode of &ldquo;Yay I finished something!&rdquo; to hopefully more intermediate habits that ask &ldquo;how will I do better next time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hat pattern came from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85015.Knitters_Handy_Book_Of_Patterns">The Knitter&rsquo;s Handy Book of Patterns</a> by Ann Budd. As I get more comfortable with knitting, my interests move from specific patterns to templates and techniques. This book seems a good step in that direction so far. Quite a few tables and charts, which calls out to old memories of gaming books. The tables are just math helpers though. I can see not needing them after a certain point. That&rsquo;s the day I&rsquo;ll be able to knit custom fit stuff from memory. Something to look forward to!</p>]]></content:encoded>

To get a comfortable fit, I cast on 84 instead of the original pattern’s 78. To produce a slightly shorter hat, I decreased every 15 stitches instead of every 20. </description>

<p>See, I left one of <a href="/post/2018/02/a-couple-crochet-hats/">my hats</a> at a friend&rsquo;s place, where somebody promptly borrowed&quot; it. I liked the hat better on them, and made another for myself.</p>
<p>Crocheting this took me under four hours, including a break to walk the dog. I impress myself.</p>
<p>Well I have to impress <em>somebody.</em> Why not me?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The &ldquo;Anarchy Irony Hat&rdquo; would have turned out better if I understood satin stitch. I think I got it now. But this has a certain goofy charm.</p>
<p>The gray and black &ldquo;Boy Beanie&rdquo; came out much nicer, even with my intentional variations from the book. I doubt I could follow a pattern to the letter even if I wrote the pattern myself.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it! I&rsquo;m all caught up on finished yarn projects. Time to write about other stuff. And knit, of course.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I knit a <a href="/post/2017/11/my-ski-beanie/">ski beanie</a> back in November, using a pattern from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170305.Son_of_Stitch_n_Bitch">Son of Stitch &rsquo;n Bitch</a>. The hat fit loose. I thought this might be because the pattern is knit flat. I produce a tighter gauge when knitting in the round. Would adapting the same hat to circular knitting produce a better fit?</p>
<p>Yes – quite a bit! The yarn thickness and needle size were the same as the previous attempt. If I were to try this experiment again I might use the next needle size up. A perfect fit would be somewhere in between this and the beanie from November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>Took me less than a week. I like that. On the other hand, I established for certain that when I knit fast my gauge loosens up. The hat fits looser than it should. I like that less. On the other other hand, I already wear it most of the time. It feels nice.
This pattern came from Son of Stitch ’n Bitch. I used Patons Astra black and — uh — some white yarn of about the right thickness.</description>

<p>This pattern works for beginners, or someone looking for a break from their big complicated projects. It might be easier if you knit in the round. There would be less purling, if nothing else. I may revisit this hat later knitting in the round, and either knit slower or use smaller needles.</p>

  <description>Ended up inbox/Knitting this one twice. Tried the large size first, and it ended up way too large for my taste. Frogged and restarted the smaller size, making a new set of mistakes. But the hat fits now and I’m not starting again!
I went with the free Weston pattern by DROPS Design, using Caron Cakes Lemon Lime yarn. Mine doesn’t look much like theirs. Different yarn causes some of that.</description>

Mine doesn’t look much like theirs. Different yarn causes some of that. Mistakes in my cabling caused a little of it. Not sure about that ribbing, though. Mine measures correctly for the pattern, but looks <em>huge</em> compared to the sample image.</p>
<h2 id="extra-notes">Extra Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>I had to do some math for placing decreases from brim to body, as the pattern   didn’t specify placement.</li>
<li>Switched from circular to DPNs for the decrease at the top. The pattern has three repeats, so you either need to be smart about placing your dpns —   which I did with the first version — or you need to use 3 dpns and be careful about ladders — which I did with the second version.</li>
<li>You will probably want a shorter ribbed section than the pattern describes if you want to knit their hat and show off the cabling.</li>
