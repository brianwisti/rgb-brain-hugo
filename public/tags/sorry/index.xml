  <description>searched my image library for “why” and got this old doodle
Kev Quirk asks:
Why do you blog?
– [Why I Have A Blog][]
I usually answer Why are you like that questions — which I get asked with some frequency, for good or ill — with “I can’t help it. It’s in my nature.” The constant puttering, interspersed with oversharing that ranges from instructive to awkward? That’s just me.</description>

searched my image library for &ldquo;why&rdquo; and got this old doodle</p>
<p><a href="https://kevq.uk/why-i-have-a-blog">Kev Quirk</a> asks:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&ndash; <cite>[Why I Have A Blog][]</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I usually answer <em>Why are you like that</em> questions — which I get asked with some frequency, for good or ill — with &ldquo;I can’t help it. It’s in my nature.&rdquo; The constant puttering, interspersed with oversharing that ranges from instructive to awkward? That’s just me. I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t do that.</p>
<p>But this came across my RSS feed, and it works too.</p>
<p>Austin Kleon, <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/04/19/do-what-you-know-how-to-do/">Do what you know how to do</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It seems stupid I would put out an album,” says Fiona Apple, of her terrific
new record, Fetch the Bolt Cutters. “But this is what I know how to do.”</p>
<p>I love that: “This is what I know how to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s true too. There are ways to putter and rant besides blogging. I could have a YouTube channel. But this is what I know how to do.</p>
<p>Thank goodness.</p>
