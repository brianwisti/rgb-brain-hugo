  <description>via Aeon.
This video essay traces the history of Kowloon Walled City from its origins as a small 17th-century military outpost to today, where it lives on in the popular imagination through films, video games and an ongoing fascination with this unlikely makeshift society.
The idea of Kowloon fascinates me. Course, by the time I heard of Kowloon it was being torn down. But once you’re aware of it you see it everywhere, used as handy sci-fi metaphor.</description>

  <description>Sometimes there’s a literal freeze
Crosscut editor-at-large Knute Berger shared evidence that the infamous Seattle Freeze — our reputation for keeping everyone at arm’s length — has been with us for a while.
The first known evidence of the Seattle Freeze:
…while researching the pandemic of 1918-1920, Ben Helle, the ever-sharp-eyed archivist at the Washington State Archives, came across a Seattle Times clipping that suggested conversation about Seattle’s frigid nature as far back as the spring of 1920.</description>

<p>It can be frustrating, but the Freeze has its <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/seattle/how-i-learned-to-love-the-seattle-freeze">good points</a>.  Less pressure for small talk and social obligations. Plus when we’ve decided we like you, you can’t get rid of us.</p>

  <title>Post: Art Nouveau, Psychedelia, and a Kalevala tangent</title>

  <description>No object was too mundane to be beautiful.
Probably my favorite comment about Art Nouveau.
Whoa. The Wikipedia entry mentions that it was called “Kalevala style” in Finland. Which — looking elsewhere — might be a little off. I mostly see references to National Romanticism, which is a bit of a mixed bag historically speaking. For Finland it was an urge to assert itself as a nation and not just some dirt swapped back and forth between Russia and Sweden.</description>

<p>Whoa. The Wikipedia entry mentions that it was called &ldquo;Kalevala style&rdquo; in Finland. Which — looking elsewhere — might be a little off. I mostly see references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_nationalism">National Romanticism</a>, which is a bit of a mixed bag historically speaking. For Finland it was an urge to assert itself as a <em>nation</em> and not just some dirt swapped back and forth between Russia and Sweden. Writing down the <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Kalevala">Kalevala</a> was a part of that same movement.</p>
<p>And yeah <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Kalevala">JRR Tolkien loved the Kalevala</a>, tying in another piece to hippy culture. I think every bookshelf I saw as a kid had a copy of The Lord of the Rings.</p>
