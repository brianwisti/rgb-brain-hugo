  <description>Hey do you want a 37 minute info dump about digital color? Of course you do.
Topics covered include: Quantization, color banding, dithering, value mapping, palette swapping, radiometry, photometry, how humans perceive color, colorimetry, spectral rendering, the rgb color model, deriving srgb, the hsl color model, gradient mapping, randomly generated color palettes, perceptual color spaces, the lab color model, oklab
tldw: use OKLAB not RGB or HSL. There’s even &#43;oklab()&#43; in CSS now.</description>

  <description>via Aeon.
This video essay traces the history of Kowloon Walled City from its origins as a small 17th-century military outpost to today, where it lives on in the popular imagination through films, video games and an ongoing fascination with this unlikely makeshift society.
The idea of Kowloon fascinates me. Course, by the time I heard of Kowloon it was being torn down. But once you’re aware of it you see it everywhere, used as handy sci-fi metaphor.</description>

  <description>Decentraland as a sad shadow of Second Life. Non-tech folks reporting on it from the perspective of maybe they’re missing something — but there’s nothing to miss. Oh and the wallet-based voting. More committees than a liberal arts college town’s anarchist collective. Ugh.
But the cat on the couch is the real star of the show.</description>

  <description>It’s a work of art in its own right. Promoting 1999’s “Glitter and Doom” tour.
Aside from that, it was pointed out in the comments that Tom Waits inspired Heath Leger’s take on The Joker. Never thought of it before, and now I can’t not hear it.</description>

Created using a decomposing 35mm print of the crime drama The Bells (1926), the experimental short Light Is Calling (2004) depicts a dreamy encounter between a soldier and a mysterious woman.

  <title>Post: Useful Overview of Neurodiversity</title>

  <description>Myk Bolkonstky’s Things Every Software Engineer Should Know About Neurodiversity:
A lot of the work in neurodiversity now seems to be suggesting that grouping traits together and circling that and calling it a thing isn’t the best way to reason about this. Insurance companies really love it.
Neurodiversity provides an alternate take on traits that are common to card/ADHD, autism, OCD, and others. Myk’s talk summarizes them better than I could, and better than resources I could find for linking.</description>

<p>Neurodiversity provides an alternate take on traits that are common to <a href="/card/adhd/">card/ADHD</a>, autism, OCD, and others. Myk’s talk summarizes them better than I could, and better than resources I could find for linking.</p>
<p>The talk lasts half an hour including questions. Some occasional audio issues thanks to everyone’s new remote life, but the transcript makes following easier.</p>
<p>Some new / clarified bits for me — aside from the above quote:</p>
<ul>
<li>many folks experience these traits, but their intensity for neurodivergent folks is such that we must plan our lives around them</li>
<li>useful medical information is not widely available</li>
<li>&ldquo;dead time&rdquo; oh god that thing where your brain won’t let you do something now because you’re planning to do something later</li>
<li>description of &ldquo;autistic burnout&rdquo; sounds like something I’m going through right now</li>

  <title>Post: Art Nouveau, Psychedelia, and a Kalevala tangent</title>

  <description>No object was too mundane to be beautiful.
Probably my favorite comment about Art Nouveau.
Whoa. The Wikipedia entry mentions that it was called “Kalevala style” in Finland. Which — looking elsewhere — might be a little off. I mostly see references to National Romanticism, which is a bit of a mixed bag historically speaking. For Finland it was an urge to assert itself as a nation and not just some dirt swapped back and forth between Russia and Sweden.</description>

<p>And yeah <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Kalevala">JRR Tolkien loved the Kalevala</a>, tying in another piece to hippy culture. I think every bookshelf I saw as a kid had a copy of The Lord of the Rings.</p>

  <description>We watched the “Code” episode of Netflix’s explained.There’s only so much that can be covered in 24 minutes, but I enjoyed the high level overview of concepts, history, and issues they presented within their constraints.
One of many iconic snippets – I may do an explainer post if I don’t find somebody else’s first – was from this 1999 interview of David Bowie. Paleofuture posted a handy transcript of the highlights.</description>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We watched the &ldquo;Code&rdquo; episode of Netflix&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80216752">explained</a>.There&rsquo;s only so much that can be covered in 24 minutes, but I enjoyed the high level overview of concepts, history, and issues they presented within their constraints.</p>
<p>One of many iconic snippets  &ndash; I may do an explainer post if I don&rsquo;t find  somebody else&rsquo;s first &ndash; was from this 1999 interview of David Bowie. <a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/watching-david-bowie-argue-with-an-interviewer-about-th-1791017656">Paleofuture</a> posted a handy transcript of the highlights.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The internet carries the flag for the subversive and possibly rebellious and chaotic and nihilistic&hellip;”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have been skeptical in 1999 about &ldquo;nihilistic.&rdquo; But after seeing things  people do for the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lulz">lulz</a>? Yeah, nihilistic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But it’s simply a different delivery system there,” Paxman says, holding his ground. “You’re arguing about something more profound.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m talking about the actual context and the state of content is going to be so different from anything we can envisage at the moment,” Bowie says. “With the interplay between the user and the provider will be so in sympatico it’s going to crush our ideas of what mediums are all about.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That summarizes the last twenty years, from Netflix to Facebook to 4chan to FOSS to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-50-feral-hogs">30-50 Feral Hogs</a> and beyond.</p>
