  <description>once again, the pic is irrelevant but Jumpy Dog sure is cute
Starting a new job on Monday, which is pretty exciting. Also, figured out a whole bunch of breadcrumb and timeline stuff for the site, starting from a shortcode example I never noticed in the card/Hugo documents before.
Hoping I finish before I get all distracted on Monday.</description>

  <description>My mom, and her plans
NOTO — the North Topeka Arts &amp; Entertainment District — asked several artists a question in a Facebook post:
What are you doing to stay creative during the COVID-19 outbreak?
My mom — subliminal message: BUY HER ART — gave the best answer:
Designing my post apocalyptic wardrobe, plotting world domination and baking cookies.</description>

  <description>NOTE
I mentioned it on hackers.town / Twitter. Even updated my relationship status on Facebook. I’ll probably leave LinkedIn alone for the moment. But worth remembering here as well.
Seattle, 2020.
COVID-19 has shut down pretty much everything in the city and beyond. Large gatherings are forbidden, or at least strongly discouraged.
Thank goodness.
No not for the disease. Sheesh. For the new social rules. They gave us an acceptable excuse to keep our wedding a small affair.</description>

<p>No not for the disease. Sheesh. For the new social rules. They gave us an  acceptable excuse to keep our wedding a small affair.</p>
<p>A <em>very</em> small affair. Five of us and four — her <a href="https://twitter.com/qlitterbang">eldest daughter</a>, <a href="https://www.shellybedsaul.com">my mom</a> (subliminal message: BUY THEIR ART) plus a couple friends who couldn’t be there because quarantine — watching on Facebook group video chat. Might have added more, but the technical issues were complicated enough as it was.</p>
<p>One of our friends got ordained so she could officiate. We wouldn’t have to worry about the courthouses closing! The same friend was sort of an anti-chaperone at an early event. She made sure we were dancing close enough and that our hands were outside the Respectful First Dance Zone.</p>
<p>And yesterday she made sure we would be able to get married. It’s the circle of life. Or something. It’s very sweet is what it is.</p>

<p>So yeah I’m happy. And the honeymoon will be nice — whenever the world opens back up again so we can have one.</p>

  <description>A paraphrased conversation:
Me “What do you want for your birthday?” She “Oh, nothing. A card, maybe.” Me “I can do that.” a stack of custom cards printed at Fedex
That’s one of her drawings superimposed over one of my drawings.
She loved it.</description>

  <title>Post: On moving your life forward</title>

  <description>From Art of Manliness: Stop Living Life “Paycheck to Paycheck”:
When you metaphorically live life “paycheck to paycheck,” you do just enough each week to maintain your current existence. You take care of the urgent and outstanding tasks the neglect of which would disrupt the status quo, but you never take action on things that would improve and progress your situation.
Even with Taskwarrior to help me tackle my TODO list, I feel the pain of living paycheck to paycheck&#34;:</description>

<blockquote>
<p>When you metaphorically live life “paycheck to paycheck,” you do just enough  each week to maintain your current existence.

</blockquote>
<p>Even with <a href="/card/taskwarrior/">Taskwarrior</a> to help me tackle my TODO list, I feel the pain of living  paycheck to paycheck&quot;:</p>
<p>I have the numbers to show that I&rsquo;m getting lots done. Somehow I feel like I&rsquo;m treading water. There&rsquo;s always more. Both the great ideas and the big goals grow stale as I address the urgent issues that must be done <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>What is the recommendation to get out of that loop?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All it takes is completing one single to-do — one single task that moves your life forward, even slightly — each week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I can do that. Well, sort of. I&rsquo;m still trying to build some kind of idea what &ldquo;forward&rdquo; means for me. However, I <em>can</em> make a point of completing one task a week that&rsquo;s been pushed aside by the high-<a href="/post/2017/12/taskwarrior-priorities/">priority</a>, immediately-<a href="/post/2018/01/taskwarrior-due-dates/">due</a> attention grabbers at the top of <code>task next</code>.</p>
