  <description>No object was too mundane to be beautiful.
Probably my favorite comment about Art Nouveau.
Whoa. The Wikipedia entry mentions that it was called “Kalevala style” in Finland. Which — looking elsewhere — might be a little off. I mostly see references to National Romanticism, which is a bit of a mixed bag historically speaking. For Finland it was an urge to assert itself as a nation and not just some dirt swapped back and forth between Russia and Sweden.</description>

<p>Whoa. The Wikipedia entry mentions that it was called &ldquo;Kalevala style&rdquo; in Finland. Which — looking elsewhere — might be a little off. I mostly see references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_nationalism">National Romanticism</a>, which is a bit of a mixed bag historically speaking. For Finland it was an urge to assert itself as a <em>nation</em> and not just some dirt swapped back and forth between Russia and Sweden. Writing down the <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Kalevala">Kalevala</a> was a part of that same movement.</p>
<p>And yeah <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Kalevala">JRR Tolkien loved the Kalevala</a>, tying in another piece to hippy culture. I think every bookshelf I saw as a kid had a copy of The Lord of the Rings.</p>
