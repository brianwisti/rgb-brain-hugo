  <description>me as a young goofy man in 2000 or so
Twenty years ago — give or take a couple weeks — I started working as a backend programmer in tech writing card/Perl code for a real live paycheck, as opposed to designing sites for cigarette money from local ISPs.
About six months later the outer layers of the dot-com bubble frayed and I experienced my first layoff. Couple recessions and a few mental breakdowns later, I’m still at it!</description>

Couple recessions and a few mental breakdowns later, I&rsquo;m still at it!</p>
<p>I have no deep thoughts on the subject. I still like writing code, even when I hate it. I also enjoy eating. Being a programmer has made both these things easier.</p>
