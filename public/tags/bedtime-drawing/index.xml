  <description>Bedtime drawing. An hour or so every night or so, for a few months. Helps me wind down from the day.
Usually that’s all it’s for, but my wife liked the finished product. So hey it’s on Design by Hümans if you need a new sweatshirt or something! I did this in Linea Sketch, which has a fixed canvas size. Better start using Procreate or Infinite Painter – and a larger canvas – just in case she wants the next one on a duvet.</description>
