  <description>Yep. I love the Notes experiment. It encourages me to post quick thoughts frequently.
I’m officially assimilating Notes into the main flow of the site. That means tags instead of their own taxonomy. It also means they get listed with posts in the blog
Got a few ideas for a tidy separation of the two, but for taxonomy and history we are back to one main flow.
[!NOTE] 2024-01-14 By now “note” is just a category taxonomy, as I’m shifting slightly away from the microblogging card/tumblelog idea to regular snapshots extracted from my personal daily notes.</description>
