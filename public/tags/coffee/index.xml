  <description>three brands of bottled coffee
Got sidetracked while picking up breakfast stuff from Uwajimaya. Should probably have finished my first cup of coffee before I left. Could have been worse. There was an entire boy band worth of that Babinski Cold Brew. I only took one.
Meanwhile, someone put a flyer on the apartment bulletin board for the Earshot Jazz Festival. Checked to see if any of the names were familiar.</description>

three brands of bottled coffee</p>
<p>Got sidetracked while picking up breakfast stuff from <a href="https://www.uwajimaya.com/">Uwajimaya</a>. Should probably have finished my first cup of coffee before I left. Could have been worse. There was an entire boy band worth of that Babinski Cold Brew. I only took one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, someone put a flyer on the apartment bulletin board for the <a href="https://www.earshot.org/2019-earshot-jazz-festival/">Earshot Jazz Festival</a>. Checked to see if any of the names were familiar. Most were new to me, but I recognized  — and enjoy — <a href="https://knifeknights.bandcamp.com/">Knife Knights</a>.</p>
<p>A jazz context makes more sense for Knife Knights than rap/hip-hop, which is where I usually see them filed. Heck, genres are meaningless anyways. My favorite music stores just arrange albums alphabetically.</p>
<p>Anyways, time to drink some coffee!</p>

  <description>Drinking leftover coffee from yesterday’s wanderings. Not to worry, I’ll get more. Just needed something quick before I get lost on BART again.</description>
