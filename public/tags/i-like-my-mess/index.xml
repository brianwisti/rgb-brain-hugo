  <description>I just figured why you give me so much trouble.
– Fezzik, The Princess Bride
Playing with an instance of WordPress on my computer by way of Local and I’m at a loss. What’s that big friendly-looking thing with the unobtrusive buttons? Where are the 150 things I need to remember for a single post?
Well, they’re probably in the part where I’d need to make sure everything is up to date.</description>

<p>Playing with an instance of <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> on my computer by way of <a href="https://localwp.com/">Local</a> and I&rsquo;m at a loss. What&rsquo;s that big friendly-looking thing with the unobtrusive buttons? Where are the 150 things I need to remember for a single post?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re probably in the part where I&rsquo;d need to make sure everything is up to date. With the static site once it&rsquo;s up I don&rsquo;t have to care about it any more.</p>
<p>My brain hurts.</p>
<p>I felt like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/characters/nm0000764">Fezzik</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I haven&rsquo;t fought one person for so long. I&rsquo;ve been specialised in groups, battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only — you know. Smaller. Not so intimidating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You use different moves when you&rsquo;re fighting half a dozen people, than when you only have to be worried about one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah, I&rsquo;ll stick with my overcomplicated site workflow for now.</p>
