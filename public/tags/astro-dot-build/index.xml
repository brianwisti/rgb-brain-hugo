  <description>this time you get a screenshot
card/Astro is great once you get started. A bit funky if you have twenty years of legacy content.
Rather than do my usual — a screenshot and maybe a “lesson learned” post — this time around I made a public repo and live instance of this in-progress experiment available for your entertainment and edification.
Oh and lesson learned: components are fussy, and the errors don’t always happen where you expect.</description>

<p><a href="/card/astro/">card/Astro</a> is great once you get started. A bit funky if you have twenty years of legacy content.</p>
<p>Rather than do my usual — a screenshot and <em>maybe</em> a &ldquo;lesson learned&rdquo; post — this time around I made a public <a href="https://github.com/brianwisti/rgb-astro">repo</a> and <a href="https://quirky-wozniak-e4e36f.netlify.app">live instance</a> of this in-progress experiment available for your entertainment and edification.</p>
<p>Oh and lesson learned: components are <em>fussy</em>, and the errors don&rsquo;t always happen where you expect. Treat all your imported HTML as XHTML, and look for stray <code>{</code> characters. You might need to convert those to <code>&amp;#123;</code>.</p>
<p>Took me months to figure that out. Hopefully it saves you a few hours of confusion.</p>

  <description>I wanted card/Asciidoctor in card/Astro. It took some fiddling, but not as much as expected. It’s a good start.
I won’t bore you with the details. Maybe later when there are more details to bore you with.
Now for the other 600 pages.</description>
