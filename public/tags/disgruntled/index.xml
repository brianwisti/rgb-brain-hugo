  <description>Ello? I only remember you exist because of your emails. Delete account.
MeWe? No API. Delete account.
Instagram? No API. Awful link handling. Delete account. Delete —del— I said “delete” dammit.
Maybe later. Uninstalled from my phone at least.
Oh right, speaking of emails. Classmates. What a terrible idea that was. Nostalgia is not my strong suit. Delete account.
That one took a minute.
Facebook? Well, that’s my main contact for too many folks.</description>

<p>Leaving the rest because I have other stuff to do.</p>
