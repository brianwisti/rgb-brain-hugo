  <description>Bedtime drawing. An hour or so every night or so, for a few months. Helps me wind down from the day.
Usually that’s all it’s for, but my wife liked the finished product. So hey it’s on Design by Hümans if you need a new sweatshirt or something! I did this in Linea Sketch, which has a fixed canvas size. Better start using Procreate or Infinite Painter – and a larger canvas – just in case she wants the next one on a duvet.</description>

  <description>I do love the fairyfloss color scheme
That says it all, really. Been a stressful oh I don’t know let’s say year and a half or so.
Tweaked and reloaded the Picnic CSS-based theme I had a while back. I missed it. Buried my bookmarking links — they’re still there for now, but I have another idea how I want to handle the “info dump” section of the site. I’ll also revisit the Config section, since it still gets traffic even though I buried it months ago.</description>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s the drawing. More hours, days, and weeks of manual symmetry in <a href="https://linea-app.com/">Linea Sketch</a>. Got a store refresh planned for the art! That was what sparked the site shuffling. Wanted a clean slate for my money-grubbing.</p>

  <description>intricate patterns drawn in the middle of the night is my jam
I don’t even know how many hours I spent on this. An hour or two a night — but not every night — since November or so?
I like it, however long I spent drawing the dang thing.
Linea takes a very constrained approach to tools. No automatic symmetry. No blend modes. Only five layers. Makes it feel like a paper sketch book, but with bonuses.</description>

  <description>
Roughly four hours of bedtime drawing over the last few days. The challenge of a brain that has to timeshare hobbies.
But hey, I remembered to leave the linework layer alone this time. You can color your own if you want!

  <description>I was going to make this a coloring thing but I accidentally did my own colors on the wrong layer. Too bad Infinite Painter doesn’t have infinite undo.
and then suddenly for no good reason — lens flare!</description>

  <description>Lots of folks stuck at home.
Feel like coloring something? I decided to share the linework for this drawing.

  <description>I spent forty hours over the last month or so inbox/Drawing this.
Couldn’t decide which aspect I liked best. Line work? Color? Values? So I went with all three.
On another note, I kinda want to study more about image formats. JPEG clearly has some issues with the red. PNG is unacceptably large thanks to all the detail work.</description>

  <description>WelshPixie draws amazing mandala images. Inspired me to do something in Linea Sketch, a drawing app defined by its constraints. No symmetry tools. A focused approach to color palettes. Brushes limited to a couple pencils, a couple pens. Five layers, no more and no less. Stuff like that.
It does have circle and straight edge drawing tools, which I clearly took full advantage of.
The only feature I miss in Linea is custom canvas sizes.</description>

<p>The result of a couple weeks of bedtime doodling.</p>
<p>Sometimes drawing constraints are fun: one layer. Two colors. One brush. Undo okay, changing brush size okay.</p>]]></content:encoded>
