<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<li>Funnel</li>

<li>Kettle or other means of making cold water hot</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extras">Extras</h3>
<p>That’s pretty much all you <em>need</em>. You’re free to add more!</p>
<ul>
<li>tea tree, sandalwood, or some other essential oil with a smell that pleases you</li>
<li>hair gel or coconut oil — for additional hold</li>
<li>epsom salt — for magnesium, I guess?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Heat some water in the kettle. If it boils, let it cool a moment. You don’t want your first hairspray story to involve burn treatment.</li>
<li>Measure out one cup (roughly 250 ml) of hot water</li>
<li>Whisk in 2 teaspoons of oil. You can vary this a bit more or less depending on how dry your hair gets.</li>
<li>Whisk in a tablespoon of sea salt. A little more gives more hold, but careful to avoid crusty hair!</li>
<li>If you want your hair to smell nice, whisk in a few drops of essential oil.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Pour your mix into the spray bottle with a funnel, unless you have very steady hands!</li>
<li>Let it cool to room temperature or at least until there’s no risk of burns.</li>
<li>Shake vigorously before each use!</li>
</ol>
<p>One batch lasts me over a month of daily use, but I intentionally go for a lighter hold. Out of my face and roughly pointed in the right direction is all I care about.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019/10/attachments/img/2019/me.jpg" alt="Still roughly pointed in the right direction halfway through the day"/></p>
<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>
<p>Now that the recipe is out of the way — I thought cookbooks were bad about forcing you to read a long story before giving you their instructions. Cookbooks are nothing. Those self-care blogs are <em>awful</em>. An evening searching and I couldn’t find the source for the basic recipe I’ve been using over the last year or so because I couldn’t get through all the <em>stories</em>.</p>
<p>I had this big story in mind about how I was watching a beard care video one night and they said &ldquo;use sea salt spray! It’s good on your hair!&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;okay!&rdquo; and they said &ldquo;use <em>our</em> sea salt spray!&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;at that price? H*ck no!&rdquo; I was even going to work in some <a href="/card/perl/">card/Perl</a> references. Talk about how making your own hair spray is another application of <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">The Three Virtues</a>.</p>
<p>But I got bored just writing the outline for that particular story. Now it’s a year later, and I’m writing down the recipe somewhere permanent to avoid losing it again.</p>
<p>Look around for ideas from other recipes, but take what you read with a grain of sea salt. We’re here for mad science and saving money, not Clean Living or Purity Of Essence.</p>

<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>This recipe is what I came up with last night after giving up on my search. You can find many recipes with varying ingredients and proportions. Experiment. Figure out what works for you.</p>
<p>Then write it down somewhere so you aren’t making something up again when you run out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>I found the recipe I started with! <a href="https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/diy/diy-sea-salt-texturizing-hair-spray/">Gimme Some Oven</a> has the information you need. Not much different than what you’ll find here, though with less Dr. Strangelove.</p>

<h2 id="fantastic-foods-sloppy-joe-french-bread-pizza">Fantastic Foods Sloppy Joe French Bread Pizza</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1 package Fantastic Foods Sloppy Joe Mix</li>
<li>1 loaf French bread</li>
<li>1 14.5-oz. can basil &amp; garlic diced tomatoes</li>
<li>Fresh basil, chopped (optional)</li>
<li>12-oz. can diced black olives</li>
<li>1 cup Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat broiler. Drain tomato liquid and reserve. Prepare Sloppy Joe mix using ¾ cup tomato liquid and ½ cup water in place of water called for in directions. Add drained tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes. Halve French bread loaf lengthwise. Spoon ½ of Sloppy Joe mixture onto each bread half. Sprinkle basil and black olives over mixture, then top with shredded cheese. Broil until cheese melts, being careful not to burn. Slice and serve.</p>
<p>Prep time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Baking/cooling time: about 5 minutes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, one thing I like to do is toast the halved loaf under the broiler for <em>maybe</em> a minute. It&rsquo;s just enough to get some crispiness, which I think goes well with the hot melty mess up top.</p>
<h2 id="the-the-story">The the story</h2>
<p>About ten years ago, my wife got me to start experimenting with vegetarian food. I started with what I knew best: boxed things. <a href="http://www.fantasticfoods.com/">Fantastic Foods</a> has a <a href="http://www.fantasticfoods.com/content/products">few tasty boxes</a> such as mixes for sloppy joes and tacos.</p>
<p>The back of the sloppy joe mix had a recipe for some insane sort of &ldquo;sloppy joe french bread pizza&rdquo;. We enjoyed it. We made it frequently. Easy enough, since the recipe was right there on the box.</p>
<p>Then one day the recipe was gone from the back of the box. It had been replaced by something far less decadent. We were disappointed, but not defeated. The recipe was on the Fantastic Foods Web site. We wrote it down and carried on, making it a couple times a year for a few years.</p>
<p>Then we moved. We lost the copy we had written down. Worse yet, the recipe was no longer on the Web site! And because it had been a while since I made it, my memory of the details was lost. We despaired - but we were not defeated. I spent the better part of an evening digging through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://fantasticfoods.com">the history of the Fantastic Foods site</a> on <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> until I found my prize. This time I saved it online in multiple locations, as a cheese-obsessed squirrel might. And now we can enjoy this whenever we want.</p>
<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s the recipe. A couple folks have asked for it recently. The carnivores among you can experiment with using meat in place of the sloppy joe mix. The vegans could use melty soy stuff instead of cheese. Hardcore vegans could replace the French bread with - I&rsquo;m not sure, really - sprout bread or something?</p>]]></content:encoded>
