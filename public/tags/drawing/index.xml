  <description>I do love the fairyfloss color scheme
That says it all, really. Been a stressful oh I don’t know let’s say year and a half or so.
Tweaked and reloaded the Picnic CSS-based theme I had a while back. I missed it. Buried my bookmarking links — they’re still there for now, but I have another idea how I want to handle the “info dump” section of the site. I’ll also revisit the Config section, since it still gets traffic even though I buried it months ago.</description>

I do love the fairyfloss color scheme</p>
<p>That says it all, really. Been a stressful oh I don&rsquo;t know let&rsquo;s say year and a half or so.</p>
<p>Tweaked and reloaded the <a href="https://picnicss.com/">Picnic CSS</a>-based theme I had a while back. I missed it. Buried my bookmarking links — they&rsquo;re still there for now, but I have another idea how I want to handle the &ldquo;info dump&rdquo; section of the site. I&rsquo;ll also revisit the Config section, since it still gets traffic even though I buried it months ago.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the drawing. More hours, days, and weeks of manual symmetry in <a href="https://linea-app.com/">Linea Sketch</a>. Got a store refresh planned for the art! That was what sparked the site shuffling. Wanted a clean slate for my money-grubbing.</p>

  <description>intricate patterns drawn in the middle of the night is my jam
I don’t even know how many hours I spent on this. An hour or two a night — but not every night — since November or so?
I like it, however long I spent drawing the dang thing.
Linea takes a very constrained approach to tools. No automatic symmetry. No blend modes. Only five layers. Makes it feel like a paper sketch book, but with bonuses.</description>

  <description> Roughly four hours of bedtime drawing over the last few days. The challenge of a brain that has to timeshare hobbies.
But hey, I remembered to leave the linework layer alone this time. You can color your own if you want!

Okay I’ve had one for a while. But I put something on it.
Buy a mug. A phone case. A backpack. A credenza?! YES!
Collect them all!
Incidentally, there appears to be a sale going on now. Discounts on everything.
Even the credenza.</description>

  <description>I drew this a few months ago — but my site flow’s had a bug which I haven’t had time to fix until the holiday weekend. So it’s a good candidate for testing.</description>

  <description>I put a shocking amount of effort in making sure this didn’t look overly polished. Seriously. Got to “nearly finished” a few times, and scrapped it because it looked too mechanical.
Okay sure. I’m drawing a science fiction cityscape on my phone. Doesn’t mean it has to look like blueprints.</description>

  <description>Testing some code changes to my site publishing workflow. But let’s make it at least a little interesting with a manual symmetry drawing I finished a little bit ago.</description>

  <description>I was going to make this a coloring thing but I accidentally did my own colors on the wrong layer. Too bad Infinite Painter doesn’t have infinite undo.
and then suddenly for no good reason — lens flare!</description>

  <description>searched my image library for “why” and got this old doodle
Kev Quirk asks:
Why do you blog?
– [Why I Have A Blog][]
I usually answer Why are you like that questions — which I get asked with some frequency, for good or ill — with “I can’t help it. It’s in my nature.” The constant puttering, interspersed with oversharing that ranges from instructive to awkward? That’s just me.</description>

searched my image library for &ldquo;why&rdquo; and got this old doodle</p>
<p><a href="https://kevq.uk/why-i-have-a-blog">Kev Quirk</a> asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you blog?</p>
<p>&ndash; <cite>[Why I Have A Blog][]</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I usually answer <em>Why are you like that</em> questions — which I get asked with some frequency, for good or ill — with &ldquo;I can’t help it. It’s in my nature.&rdquo; The constant puttering, interspersed with oversharing that ranges from instructive to awkward? That’s just me. I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t do that.</p>
<p>But this came across my RSS feed, and it works too.</p>
<p>Austin Kleon, <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/04/19/do-what-you-know-how-to-do/">Do what you know how to do</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It seems stupid I would put out an album,” says Fiona Apple, of her terrific
new record, Fetch the Bolt Cutters. “But this is what I know how to do.”</p>
<p>I love that: “This is what I know how to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s true too. There are ways to putter and rant besides blogging. I could have a YouTube channel. But this is what I know how to do.</p>
<p>Thank goodness.</p>
