  <description>From Happy 20th to This Blog!:
It‘s tempting to think that The Thing of my career has been NetNewsWire. And that’s kinda true. But the thing I’ve done the longest, love the most, and am most proud of is this blog.
This Brent Simmons post is going around a lot in my RSS feed. Probably because many of us feel similar — or want to.
It took me a long time to admit that my site was a blog.</description>

<p>This <a href="https://inessential.com/">Brent Simmons</a> post is going around a lot in my RSS feed. Probably because many of us feel similar — or want to.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to admit that my site was a blog. I disliked the word and aspired to be more like the sprawling mass of <a href="http://softpanorama.org/">Softpanorama</a>. <em>Content</em> not a mere stream of distractions. This was before <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=seattle%20weather%20update%20from%3Abrianwisti%20&amp;src=typed_query">Twitter</a>, mind you.</p>
<p>Eventually I settled down. Time is a factor for all content.</p>
<p>And if I was starting today I doubt Softpanorama would be my target. Maybe <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah like I could ever be that focused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of my blog site thing. I&rsquo;ve made friends through it. I&rsquo;ve lost a couple. It&rsquo;s all over the place, but very much represents the changes and consistencies in who I&rsquo;ve been the last couple decades.</p>
<p>Start your own blog site thing if you haven&rsquo;t already. Have fun!</p>

  <title>Post: Bookmarking the KEXP livestream links</title>

  <description>card/KEXP used to show their live streaming links on the site. Not the browser stream, podcast library, video archive, or Windows, iOS, or Android apps. An actual URI I can load in Audacious or whatever music player I’m using that week.
I love all the other stuff. Heck, as an amplifier I’m happy to see to see all the work my money goes towards. Just – sometimes all I want is the music.</description>

<p>Dug around and found a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KEXP/comments/c9dgwg/livestream_url/">Reddit post</a> with current links.</p>

<p>Now I can listen to the livestream again without having a browser tab open.</p>
