  <description>GitHub Copilot is a development tool from Microsoft driven by a Large Language Model (LLM) — one piece of the very big tech trend described as “AI”.
Copilot acts as a super-powered autocomplete for developers. Sort of like an LSP, but this goes much further. Where an LSP might give you an identifier or point you to a definition, Copilot generates entire expressions and blocks of code. It assembles reasonable-looking code from what it’s been fed, including your own current projects.</description>

<p>Some people like Copilot.</p>

This technology is in its infancy and it’s already writing code that’s better than many developers I’ve met.

<p>Some people dislike it so much they are taking Microsoft to court over it.</p>

By training their AI sys­tems on pub­lic GitHub repos­i­to­ries (though based on their pub­lic state­ments, pos­si­bly much more) we con­tend that the defen­dants have vio­lated the legal rights of a vast num­ber of cre­ators who posted code or other work under cer­tain open-source licenses on GitHub.

<p>I tried Copilot out, even though I&rsquo;m unhappy about the wholesale appropriation of publicly visible code regardless of license. Ignoring it seemed impractical. What if it really is a game-changer?</p>
<p>After a month? No. Copilot is not a useful tool for me. It&rsquo;s always offering helpful suggestions. Those suggestions are frequently incorrect. Its errors are not always obvious. But it&rsquo;ll keep offering them until you make it stop.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> Copilot would work better if I used fewer languages and experimented with fewer frameworks. As it is, the experience is not unlike pair programming with someone who <em>always</em> tries to paste in the top result from Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some React code!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice, but I&rsquo;m writing an Astro component.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what that algorithm looks like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you! Wait no. This is Python. My code is Nim.</p>
<p>My Copilot trial run has been a month of occasional usefulness in a sea of interruptions just as I was typing something. It changes the game all right. And the new game is &ldquo;let me break your flow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So no. Not for me in its current form.</p>
