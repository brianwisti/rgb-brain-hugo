  <description>I put a shocking amount of effort in making sure this didn’t look overly polished. Seriously. Got to “nearly finished” a few times, and scrapped it because it looked too mechanical.
Okay sure. I’m drawing a science fiction cityscape on my phone. Doesn’t mean it has to look like blueprints.</description>

  <description>Screaming frog? Angry Pac-Man? No idea.
At least it’s a break from symmetry doodles.</description>

  <description>I was going to make this a coloring thing but I accidentally did my own colors on the wrong layer. Too bad Infinite Painter doesn’t have infinite undo.
and then suddenly for no good reason — lens flare!</description>

  <title>Post: Chaotic Symmetry</title>

  <description>I wish I drew this one larger. Then again, I thought it was going to be a quick bedtime sketch. Ended up spending probably around 40 hours on it.
I particularly enjoyed enabling and disabling symmetry at different stages. Made for what feels to me like a more organic image. If I were to go back and change anything, it might be to make foreground and background a little easier to differentiate.</description>

<p>The result of a couple weeks of bedtime doodling.</p>
<p>Sometimes drawing constraints are fun: one layer. Two colors. One brush. Undo okay, changing brush size okay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A Samsung Note 9 means my phone drawing has been upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Samsung Note 9 means my phone drawing has been upgraded.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019/03/../../../attachments/img/2019/cover-2019-03-19.jpg" alt="attachments/img/2019/cover-2019-03-19.jpg"/></p>
<p>I feel like I neglected the blog this year. That&rsquo;s probably because of the half dozen draft posts I still need to finish. Also, I&rsquo;ve been busy working, drawing, learning, and even — <em>gasp</em> — socializing!</p>
<p>One of the big moments for me? Well, aside from dancing in public, which I hadn&rsquo;t done in well over a decade? The purchase of a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Refurbished, because if I can save a few bucks I will. Drawing on it is a delight, pretty much. Not <em>quite</em> as smooth as iPad + Pencil, but far better than using a capacitive stylus on other phones. Overall, the Note takes me back to the days of having a small sketchbook with me at all times.</p>
<p>The Note is Android, which means I could install <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> on it and grab a <a href="/post/2019/01/circular-grids-with-python-and-pillow/">circle template</a> from my desktop. My first serious sketch with the Note was of course another manual symmetry doodle.</p>
<p>The Note&rsquo;s specs meant that I could have many layers for relatively large images (this one is 4084x4084 pixels) and still get a smooth drawing experience. I like the end result, too.</p>
<p>I kind of want to take a break from the super detailed symmetry drawings,  though. Seems like that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been doing lately! Maybe practice some cartoon style doodles. Pull out the Mark Kistler books if I have to.</p>
<p>Oh, and I should finish those draft posts at some point.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Post: Buy My Stuff At Design by Hümans</title>

  <description>I opened a store on the Design by Hümans site! I also made card/Hugo warn me when I forget purchase links.
Well, one design. I only got things going yesterday, with a quick sketch on a plain white background. Future plans include adjusting old designs and creating new ones for the store, with an intended pace of roughly one design per week.
Of course I already worked out the site integration.</description>

<p>Of course I already worked out the site integration. Everything on Random Geekery tagged &ldquo;buy me&rdquo; should have a direct link to its page on the store. I get a lovely Hugo <a href="http://gohugo.io/functions/errorf/"><code>errorf</code></a> message if I forget the link.</p>

  <description>The other night I went out, and brought my iPad. Sketching calms me when sitting in a public space. This is the final version of a doodle started that night.
I get nervous about color, but decided this time to relax a bit and enjoy myself. The result pleases me.</description>

  <description>Thought I’d make a picture with the right aspect ratio for my desktop. Used Infinite Painter’s radial symmetry tool for most of the linework, then over to finish up with color and shade in Procreate.</description>
