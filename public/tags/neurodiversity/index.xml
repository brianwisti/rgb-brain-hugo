  <description>Myk Bolkonstky’s Things Every Software Engineer Should Know About Neurodiversity:
A lot of the work in neurodiversity now seems to be suggesting that grouping traits together and circling that and calling it a thing isn’t the best way to reason about this. Insurance companies really love it.
Neurodiversity provides an alternate take on traits that are common to card/ADHD, autism, OCD, and others. Myk’s talk summarizes them better than I could, and better than resources I could find for linking.</description>

<p>Neurodiversity provides an alternate take on traits that are common to <a href="/card/adhd/">card/ADHD</a>, autism, OCD, and others. Myk’s talk summarizes them better than I could, and better than resources I could find for linking.</p>
<p>The talk lasts half an hour including questions. Some occasional audio issues thanks to everyone’s new remote life, but the transcript makes following easier.</p>
<p>Some new / clarified bits for me — aside from the above quote:</p>
<ul>
<li>many folks experience these traits, but their intensity for neurodivergent folks is such that we must plan our lives around them</li>
<li>useful medical information is not widely available</li>
<li>&ldquo;dead time&rdquo; oh god that thing where your brain won’t let you do something now because you’re planning to do something later</li>
<li>description of &ldquo;autistic burnout&rdquo; sounds like something I’m going through right now</li>
</ul>
