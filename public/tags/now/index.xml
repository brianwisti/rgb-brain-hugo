<dt><a href="https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/human-curation/">I miss human curation</a></dt>
<dd>Cassidy&rsquo;s correct that the human-curated Web is still here — I mean hello it me — and also correct that it&rsquo;s a lot harder to find thanks to algorithm-driven social networks and search engines; guess we&rsquo;ll have to go back to old-fashioned ways like blogrolls, webrings, bookmark pages, and variations like this weekly review</dd>

<dd>predicting that more LLM spam and the &ldquo;AI&rdquo; boom in general will result in more people splitting off from the old big social networks and platforms, being more creative to differentiate between the plausible mediocrity generated by automated systems; I would love for it to be true</dd>

  <description>sitting by the pool near the beach while she’s in the pool
We got married in March of 2020. Finally getting our Hawai’i honeymoon in December of 2022. But of course I need a few minutes here and there to putter.
Looking up how IndieWeb folks work with ActivityPub — the standard used by Mastodon and other Fediverse applications to communicate.
But honestly I’m just taking pics of her and enjoying the sun.</description>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thinking hard about whether to keep splitting my attention between multiple sites.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s only two. But I consolidated everything to <em>Random Geekery</em> several years back for a reason: if I have more than one site, at least one will be badly neglected.</p>
<p>Not taking any hard action at the moment. I&rsquo;m just gonna keep pondering for a bit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brain insists on a CLI flow for this tumblelog. So of course I have to mess up my perfectly functional flow.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ll fiddle with it more later, but here&rsquo;s what I got at the moment.</p>
<p>I consider the Org inactive timestamps title core to the tumblelog flow. Better let <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/dateformat/"><code>time.Format</code></a> produce something plausible in my <code>posts.md</code> Hugo archetype.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-md" data-lang="md"><span class="line"><span class="cl">---
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">title: &#34;[{{ time.Format &#34;2006-01-02 Mon 15:04&#34; .Date }}]&#34;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">author:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">-</span> Brian Wisti
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">date: {{ .Date }}
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">tags: []
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">draft: false
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">---
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The archetype uses <a href="/card/yaml/">card/YAML</a> frontmatter instead of <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co">ox-hugo</a>&rsquo;s default <a href="/card/toml/">card/TOML</a>. I find manually managing the tags is easier that way.</p>
<p>My brain picked <a href="/card/ruby/">Ruby</a> for the script to generate and open a new post, thanks mainly to the convenience of Piotr Murach&rsquo;s <a href="https://ttytoolkit.org">TTY toolkit</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>All it does is ask Hugo to create a new post based on the archetype, and then open that post file in my <code>$EDITOR</code>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to more later. I know from past experience I can use <code>tty-command</code> to manage the git bits after I&rsquo;m done writing.</p>
<p>But apparently if I want to pay rent I need to <em>work</em>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>Been sick the last couple days. Unsurprising after a week in Vegas. Modest fever confirmed, so it’s not just me being wimpy. At least it’s not COVID, according to home swab test.</description>

  <description>Eight hours of sleep. Such a miracle! Course I think I mentioned we’re staying right in the Fremont Experience, so that required waiting until around 2am to fall asleep.
I’m having some fun despite myself, but I am also very much looking forward to getting home.</description>

  <description>Oh hey DNS has propagated. So the card/tumblelog has a proper URL now: https://randomgeekery.life.
[!NOTE] 2023-09-18 Pulled into the main blog. The ignored extra site is going away.
Meanwhile, getting updates that our critters are being properly cared for while we’re on vacation, so I can do very important things like take pictures of shoes.

  <description>Trying to use Hugo and ox-hugo to have sort of a tumblelog with Org mode.
What’s a tumblelog? Just kind of a stream-of-consciousness blog. Might have recurring topics. Might not. Posts might have titles. They might not. Might be short notes. Might be long essays.
Why? Inspired by the Rachel Quickblogge. Course she did hers the smart and quick way, using WordPress. But I gotta be me, and overthinking it is what I do best.</description>

  <description>hey we got some snow
Would you look at that? We got some actual weather.
What else?
Been keeping myself busy with the JavaScript static site generators. Last week’s card/Astro experiment got slow so I’ve been messing with card/Eleventy.
Probably my last note of the year, so: Happy New Year!</description>
