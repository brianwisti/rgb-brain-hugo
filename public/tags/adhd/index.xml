  <description>Installed Ruby on the most recent EndeavourOS 1 install so I could run my script that adds a post to my site’s primary Hugo iteration as I work on a Gatsby iteration of the site so I can convincingly claim knowledge of React 2 when talking to recruiters during this year’s interminable job search so I can get a new job and maybe get back on ADHD meds and maybe occasionally focus on one thing at a time and — um — where was I?</description>

In fact, ADHD is an invisible disability, which is exactly what it sounds like: “a physical, mental or neurological condition that is not visible from the outside, yet can limit or challenge a person’s movements, senses, or activities” (Invisible Disabilities Association). Plenty of forms of neurodivergence, including autism spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and learning differences can be considered invisible disabilities.

<p>It&rsquo;s not in-depth or anything, but offers a little pushback to the &ldquo;ADHD is a superpower&rdquo; myth. That myth is handy for the occasional self-help pep talk — &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good enough. I&rsquo;m smart enough. And gosh-darn it, this funky brain wiring is a superpower!&rdquo; — but it&rsquo;s not true. The self-awareness and arsenal of coping techniques like task automation can look impressive to the untrained eye.
Those only give roughly the same functionality as a normal person going about a normal day. And oh goodness if you&rsquo;re in a context where those techniques aren&rsquo;t helpful? You&rsquo;ve got unpartitioned tasks with a poorly defined goal that is important and kinda urgent, but stretched over months?<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The floundering.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not even get into the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-way-adhd/202106/adhd-and-rejection-sensitivity-dysphoria">Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD)</a> aspect.</p>
<p>Anyways the dog needs to go out and I should probably eat breakfast and I think I mentioned something about React. Back to it!</p>
<p>And maybe check email.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used React at work some, but my brain needs the ritual of incorporating a tool or framework into my site building work flow before it&rsquo;ll let me say &ldquo;yes I know that&rdquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>STARE AT THE FROG FOR HOURS AND
FEEL LIKE A FAILURE FOR AVOIDING THE
FROG ALL DAY AND GETTING NOTHING
DONE AT ALL MEANWHILE WONDERING
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU AND WHY YOU
CAN&rsquo;T FOLLOW THIS BASIC ADVICE THAT
MUST WORK PERFECTLY FOR EVERYONE
ELSE AND DREAD SEEING THE SAME
FROG WAITING FOR YOU TOMORROW</p>
