  <description>sitting by the pool near the beach while she&#39;s in the pool
We got married in March of 2020. Finally getting our Hawai’i honeymoon in December of 2022. But of course I need a few minutes here and there to putter.
Looking up how IndieWeb folks work with ActivityPub — the standard used by Mastodon and other Fediverse applications to communicate.
But honestly I’m just taking pics of her and enjoying the sun.</description>

  <description>Eight hours of sleep. Such a miracle! Course I think I mentioned we’re staying right in the Fremont Experience, so that required waiting until around 2am to fall asleep.
I’m having some fun despite myself, but I am also very much looking forward to getting home.</description>

  <description>Oh hey DNS has propagated. So the card/tumblelog has a proper URL now: https://randomgeekery.life.
2023-09-18
Pulled into the main blog. The ignored extra site is going away.
Meanwhile, getting updates that our critters are being properly cared for while we’re on vacation, so I can do very important things like take pictures of shoes.
