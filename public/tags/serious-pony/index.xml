  <description>Yeah this is about Stallman being back on the board of the FSF. Kev Quirk has good thoughts about how it was communicated. Me, I’m tired. I had just been thinking how some of my favorite people have been driven off the public Internet via doxxing and harassment.
And now Free Software’s problematic fave — one of many, to be honest — is back, without so much as a hint of personal responsibility.</description>

Kev Quirk has good <a href="https://kevq.uk/my-thoughts-on-richard-stallmans-return-to-the-fsf-board/">thoughts</a> about how it was communicated. Me, I&rsquo;m tired.

<p>And now Free Software&rsquo;s problematic fave — one of many, to be honest — is back, without so much as a hint of personal responsibility. Bah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not purging my system or anything, but I&rsquo;m sure as hell done making a point of using GNU tools. This affects the FSF not one bit. It&rsquo;s only me conserving my energy for things I can care about.</p>
