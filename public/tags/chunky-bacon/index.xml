  <description>Yeah this is about Stallman being back on the board of the FSF. Kev Quirk has good thoughts about how it was communicated. Me, I’m tired. I had just been thinking how some of my favorite people have been driven off the public Internet via doxxing and harassment.
And now Free Software’s problematic fave — one of many, to be honest — is back, without so much as a hint of personal responsibility.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m not purging my system or anything, but I&rsquo;m sure as hell done making a point of using GNU tools. This affects the FSF not one bit. It&rsquo;s only me conserving my energy for things I can care about.</p>

  <description>Seriously. Chunky. Bacon.
Outlining a post about my Notes experiment. Learned that _why coined card/tumblelog, which is sort of what the notes are. And then I wanted to make this note. With the foxes. But I couldn’t find a nice big version. So I made a nice big version. It’s Attribution-ShareAlike, just like the original. You can use it.
Go read the Poignant Guide when you have time. I put CLOSURE on my list.</description>
