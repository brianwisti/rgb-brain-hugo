We went to the Apple store. I played with a new iPad Pro. Tried hard not to like it, but it was a really pleasant experience.
The demo iPad had a great note-taking app that could help my search for an app that let me handwrite notes and then search through their content later.
Been messing with Windows and inbox/WSL more lately. So we went to the Microsoft store too.</description>

<p>Been messing with Windows and <em>inbox/WSL</em> more lately. So we went to the Microsoft store too. I tried hard to like it, but everything felt a little clumsy and disappointing after the smoothness of the Apple devices.</p>
<p>When I got home I had to find and install <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">GoodNotes</a>, the notebook app I played with at the Apple Store, on my own iPad. Yeah I like it. This will come in real handy.</p>
<p>Oh and I want a matte screen <em>protector</em>. Supposedly gives you more of a paper feel when working on the iPad.</p>
