  <description>[!NOTE] I mentioned it on hackers.town / Twitter. Even updated my relationship status on Facebook. I’ll probably leave LinkedIn alone for the moment. But worth remembering here as well.
Seattle, 2020.
COVID-19 has shut down pretty much everything in the city and beyond. Large gatherings are forbidden, or at least strongly discouraged.
Thank goodness.
No not for the disease. Sheesh. For the new social rules. They gave us an acceptable excuse to keep our wedding a small affair.</description>

<p>No not for the disease. Sheesh. For the new social rules. They gave us an  acceptable excuse to keep our wedding a small affair.</p>
<p>A <em>very</em> small affair. Five of us and four — her <a href="https://twitter.com/qlitterbang">eldest daughter</a>, <a href="https://www.shellybedsaul.com">my mom</a> (subliminal message: BUY THEIR ART) plus a couple friends who couldn’t be there because quarantine — watching on Facebook group video chat. Might have added more, but the technical issues were complicated enough as it was.</p>
<p>One of our friends got ordained so she could officiate. We wouldn’t have to worry about the courthouses closing! The same friend was sort of an anti-chaperone at an early event. She made sure we were dancing close enough and that our hands were outside the Respectful First Dance Zone.</p>
<p>And yesterday she made sure we would be able to get married. It’s the circle of life. Or something. It’s very sweet is what it is.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020/03/attachments/img/2020/thumbs-up.jpg" title="You want a serious event, talk to someone else" alt="Newlyweds and friend grinning with thumbs up"/></p>
<p>So yeah I’m happy. And the honeymoon will be nice — whenever the world opens back up again so we can have one.</p>

  <description>A paraphrased conversation:
Me “What do you want for your birthday?” She “Oh, nothing. A card, maybe.” Me “I can do that.” a stack of custom cards printed at Fedex
That’s one of her drawings superimposed over one of my drawings.
She loved it.</description>
