  <description>Decided I wanted a copy of “Learning Perl 6” before it becomes “Learning Raku”. I give my bookshelf room for nostalgia, though the name shift to card/Raku is understandable.
And of course I needed a physical copy of the 20th Anniversary Pragmatic Programmer.</description>

  <description>I have been spending most of my free time working on a Rails project for the Mary’s Place day shelter. At some point - probably after many scan/edit cycles with metric_fu – it occurred to me that even though my Rails knowledge has increased over the last year, my core card/Ruby skills have not. They have stayed static. They may even have deteriorated a bit, since Rails does so much work for the developer.</description>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been spending most of my free time working on a <a href="https://github.com/brianwisti/marysplace-rails">Rails project</a> for the <a href="http://www.marysplaceseattle.org/">Mary&rsquo;s Place</a> day shelter. At some point - probably after many scan/edit cycles with <a href="https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu">metric_fu</a> &ndash; it occurred to me that even though my Rails knowledge has increased over the last year, my core <a href="/card/ruby/">card/Ruby</a> skills have not. They have stayed static. They may even have deteriorated a bit, since Rails does so much work for the developer.</p>
<p>This seems like a perfect opportunity to reread the Pickaxe book <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0">Programming Ruby</a>. This might not count as a reread, though. I have not read it cover to cover since the second edition came out. They are on to the fourth edition now.</p>
