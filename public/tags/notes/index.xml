  <description>Yep. I love the Notes experiment. It encourages me to post quick thoughts frequently.
I’m officially assimilating Notes into the main flow of the site. That means tags instead of their own taxonomy. It also means they get listed with posts in the blog
Got a few ideas for a tidy separation of the two, but for taxonomy and history we are back to one main flow.

By now “note” is just a category taxonomy, as I’m shifting slightly away from the microblogging card/tumblelog idea to regular snapshots extracted from my personal daily notes.</description>

  <description>GoodNotes screenshot
We went to the Apple store. I played with a new iPad Pro. Tried hard not to like it, but it was a really pleasant experience.
The demo iPad had a great note-taking app that could help my search for an app that let me handwrite notes and then search through their content later.
Been messing with Windows and inbox/WSL more lately. So we went to the Microsoft store too.</description>

<p>Been messing with Windows and <em>inbox/WSL</em> more lately. So we went to the Microsoft store too. I tried hard to like it, but everything felt a little clumsy and disappointing after the smoothness of the Apple devices.</p>
<p>When I got home I had to find and install <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">GoodNotes</a>, the notebook app I played with at the Apple Store, on my own iPad. Yeah I like it. This will come in real handy.</p>
<p>Oh and I want a matte screen <em>protector</em>. Supposedly gives you more of a paper feel when working on the iPad.</p>

  <description>card/IndieWeb contains most of the philosophy behind my notes project: Own your own data, make what you need, use what you make, longevity, and most important:
Have fun. When the web took off in the 90’s people began designing personal sites with tools such as GeoCities. These spaces had Java applets, garish green background and seventeen animated GIFs. It may have been ugly and badly coded but it was fun. Keep the web weird and interesting.</description>

<p>Have a few draft blog posts that I need to get back to, but I swear I&rsquo;m working on the documenting part. And there&rsquo;s not much to open-source yet. It&rsquo;s mostly process, which &mdash; yeah &mdash; needs to be documented.</p>

  <description>There was a bug in the “announce” part of my “publish/announce” flow. Let me try that again.

  <description>The Note list pages are paginated now, at least until I come up with a better approach. Plus I think the site has an automatic publish/announce flow now, after a few weeks of futzing around in my free time.
Let’s find out.</description>

  <description>Seriously. Chunky. Bacon.
Outlining a post about my Notes experiment. Learned that _why coined card/tumblelog, which is sort of what the notes are. And then I wanted to make this note. With the foxes. But I couldn’t find a nice big version. So I made a nice big version. It’s Attribution-ShareAlike, just like the original. You can use it.
Go read the Poignant Guide when you have time. I put CLOSURE on my list.</description>

  <description>Moved into a new apartment. Waiting for Internet on Tuesday. It’s Sunday.
Continuing to work slow but sure on my notes experiment. Today: a card/Hugo archetype that includes a full inbox/ISO 8601 timestamp, via dateFormat.
--- date: &#34;{{ dateFormat &#34;2006-01-02T15:04:05-07:00&#34; .Date }}&#34; hashtags: - --- SAY SOMETHING And yeah, hashtags are related to but distinct from tags. Basically, I have a particular protocol for tags and posts. I can be more informal with notes and hashtags.</description>

  <description>So hey. Just a quick note to say I’m adding quick notes to the site. Get my microblogging off Twitter, basically. Though it will likely have more in common with a Tumblog.</description>
