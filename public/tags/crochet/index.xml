  <description>A friend asked me to inbox/Crochet a potholder based on an image she saw online. I tracked the image down to its source: the “ManHandle Pot Holder” on Margaret Calver’s ayarnnut Etsy store.
The pattern wasn’t too hard to figure out. I made several potholders as I worked through the process.
chain a few - I settled on four increase at a pace you like until you reach the desired circumference single chain around until you reach the desired length single chain some texture where it looks about right This description is deliberately vague because I made each potholder different, both for fun and because the natural world is full of variety.</description>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Yes, they look like that on purpose.</h2><p>A friend asked me to <em>inbox/Crochet</em> a potholder based on an image she saw online. I tracked the image down to its source: the &ldquo;ManHandle Pot Holder&rdquo; on Margaret Calver’s <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ayarnnut">ayarnnut</a> Etsy store.</p>

<p>The pattern wasn’t too hard to figure out. I made several potholders as I worked through the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>chain a few - I settled on four</li>
<li>increase at a pace you like until you reach the desired circumference</li>
<li>single chain around until you reach the desired length</li>
<li>single chain some texture where it looks about right</li>
</ul>
<p>This description is deliberately vague because I made each potholder different, both for fun and because the natural world is full of variety.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018/08/attachments/img/2018/collected.jpg" alt="Potholders collected on display"/></p>
<p>I shared images of the collection as I worked on it. Some people — okay, some <em>guys</em> — presented surprising ideas for the intended usage. This is not a penis sweater. If nothing else, think of the chafing. And related to their bold claims about needing one that was significantly longer: you don’t want excess material flopping uselessly. That’s a safety hazard.</p>
<p>The potholder fits over the pot handle like so.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018/08/attachments/img/2018/demonstrated.jpg" title="Demonstration of usage" alt="Potholders cover handle of the pot"/></p>
<p>But you do you.</p>
<p>Want one? Crochet it yourself! Don’t want to do that? <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ayarnnut">Buy one</a> so the genius who came up with this idea gets some money!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-f-bomb">original pattern</a> uses <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Knit-the-Duplicate-Stitch">duplicate stitch knitting</a> for the letter, but after a couple frustrated hours I gave up on that and crocheted the letter on. I expect to make more of these. The lettering should improve.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>See, I left one of <a href="/post/2018/02/a-couple-crochet-hats/">my hats</a> at a friend&rsquo;s place, where somebody promptly borrowed&quot; it. I liked the hat better on them, and made another for myself.</p>
<p>Crocheting this took me under four hours, including a break to walk the dog. I impress myself.</p>
<p>Well I have to impress <em>somebody.</em> Why not me?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This time I crocheted two balls, referencing the <a href="https://youtu.be/mJ47MLlrLzw">same video</a> as my <a href="/post/2015/03/amigurumi-ball-thing/">other</a> crochet ball. Today I put faces on them. My first projects with googly eyes or embroidery floss. I must assume I will improve at both.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The &ldquo;Anarchy Irony Hat&rdquo; would have turned out better if I understood satin stitch. I think I got it now. But this has a certain goofy charm.</p>
<p>The gray and black &ldquo;Boy Beanie&rdquo; came out much nicer, even with my intentional variations from the book. I doubt I could follow a pattern to the letter even if I wrote the pattern myself.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it! I&rsquo;m all caught up on finished yarn projects. Time to write about other stuff. And knit, of course.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>This is my version of the “Stripes (And Stripes) Forever Scarf” from Stitch ’N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker. It came together quickly. The only real challenge was getting the first row of single chains in.
Someday I’ll stick exactly to a pattern. Today is not that day. Here are the things I intentionally changed.
The pattern uses four colors, but I only had three I wanted to use for it I like longer scarves, so I added about six inches of length.</description>
