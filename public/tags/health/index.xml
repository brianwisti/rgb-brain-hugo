  <description>Here’s an interesting correlation from BBC News: Slow walking at 45 “a sign of faster aging”:
In general, the slower walkers tended to show signs of “accelerated ageing” with their lungs, teeth and immune systems in worse shape than those who walked faster.
The more unexpected finding was that brain scans showed the slower walkers were more likely to have older-looking brains too.
As a fast walker who gets stuck behind slow walkers on the way to work, I endorse these findings.</description>
