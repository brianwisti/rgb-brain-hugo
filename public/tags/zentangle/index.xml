<p>Last month I read an article about <a href="https://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2012/08/duotone-illustrations.html">duotone illustrations</a> and decided to try
a version of the technique myself someday. Today was that day.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duotone">Duotone</a> uses two colors — usually black and a color such as blue or red — to make an image. It was popular for a while in 20th Century illustration because it cost less than full color printing. Skilled duotone illustrators like <a href="https://americanillustration.org/project/mead-schaeffer/">Mead Schaeffer</a> produced visually arresting images.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2017/12/attachments/img/2017/mead-schaeffer-red.jpg" alt="&ldquo;Red&rdquo; by Mead Schaeffer"/></p>
<p><em>Illustration by Mead Schaeffer via <a href="https://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2012/08/duotone-illustrations.html">Muddy Colors</a></em></p>
<p>I wanted to manually create duotone images in sketch apps like Procreate. Time to describe what I came up with.</p>
<p>This post isn’t a tutorial, but the information may be useful to you. For that matter it may be useful to <em>me</em>. That’s really what this whole site is about, after all: making life easier for future me, and hopefully maybe you too.</p>
<p>I had a couple of self-imposed limitations while making this. I deliberately chose to only use flat color for this experiment — no shading to speak of. I also used a smaller canvas than usual. It wasn’t a technical limitation, but it did limit the detail I could put into the image.</p>
<p>In retrospect, that’s probably a good thing for this experiment. I ended up with about 50 layers the way I put things together, and this might have slowed my iPad down with a large image.</p>
<h2 id="linework">Linework</h2>
<p>The first finished step is a solid black and white image. It started out as a
knotwork panel demonstration, but somewhere along the way I decided the panel
needed extras. Most of those extras came from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26311641-the-tangles-of-kells">Tangles of Kells</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2017/12/attachments/img/2017/duotone-panel-linework.png" alt="Linework"/></p>
<h2 id="values">Values</h2>
<p>Then I put the values in, working from a grayscale palette. Nothing fancy going on here. The background is darker, the foreground is lighter, with a couple small variations along the way.</p>
<p>I set the drop shadow layers to &ldquo;Soft Light&rdquo; so they wouldn’t obscure whatever was beneath them.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2017/12/attachments/img/2017/duotone-panel-values.png" alt="Values"/></p>
<h2 id="color">Color</h2>
<p>For color, I created a new layer under the value layers, which I set to &ldquo;Multiply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here’s what that looked like, with everything else but linework cut out.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2017/12/attachments/img/2017/duotone-panel-color.png" alt="Color"/></p>
<p>I had an initial stage where all the shadows were hatched lines. Duotone didn’t occur to me until near the end of linework. I’ll try value-based shading for everything in some future sketches.</p>
<p>In order to have value mix nicely with color, I put each color layer beneath its value layer and set the value layer’s mode to &ldquo;Multiply.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="final">Final</h2>
<p>And that’s how I ended up with this.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2017/12/attachments/img/2017/cover-2017-12-19.jpg" alt="Final image"/></p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>That was fun.</p>
<p>I want to explore duotone more, trying some specific ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shading instead of value blocks.</li>
<li>Use higher contrasting values. This ended up just a tiny bit muddy to my eyes.</li>
<li>Multiple color layers — tritone?</li>
<li>Mixing grayscale values and color values in a style more similar to the  duotone illustrations I like so much.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Post: Knotwork Practice</title>

  <description>This started with practicing a knotwork pattern from Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction, and ended up as an exercise in how long I could add stuff before I got bored. Thirteen hours. Not bad.
Not in a row, of course.
Oh and I threw in a couple tangle elements from The Tangles of Kells.
I might be ready to try drawing things on purpose again. Usually it’s just that my hands get itchy when I see blank space.</description>

<p>I tried cleaning it up with <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>. The end result displeased me so much that I switched to a grayscale of the original scan.</p>]]></content:encoded>
