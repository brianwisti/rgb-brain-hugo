  <description>Enso is “a hybrid visual and textual functional language.” So far, the demo is cooler than the alpha. Because so far I have not yet gotten the alpha nightly release to work.
But good lord that is a cool demo.
Enthusiastic, too.</description>

  <description>Got distracted by a note from @choldgraf about MyST, a Markdown flavor aimed at technical writing, in a Twitter conversation that was not specifically about MyST.
Two things you may be interested in:
Markdown in Sphinx : https://t.co/52Rj05JsqV
Automatically rebuild are load docs in sphinx: https://t.co/9lvFyCbB0W
Pydata theme: https://t.co/9qXss5cN15
Lots of other nice themes here: https://t.co/27G9oawNVu
— Chris Holdgraf (@choldgraf) September 3, 2021 This distracted me from the NuxtJS blog idea that was distracting me from a card/Nikola blog idea that was distracting me from an attempt at porting my site to card/Astro that was distracting me from a card/Nanoc-in-Python project idea that was distracting me from preparing a client site proposal that was distracting me from Labor Day weekend prep that was distracting me from the work chat that was distracting me from work.</description>

<p>This distracted me from the <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">NuxtJS</a> blog idea that was distracting me from a <a href="/card/nikola/">card/Nikola</a> blog idea that was distracting me from an attempt at porting my site to <a href="/card/astro/">card/Astro</a> that was distracting me from a <a href="/card/nanoc/">card/Nanoc</a>-in-Python project idea that was distracting me from preparing a client site proposal that was distracting me from Labor Day weekend prep that was distracting me from the work chat that was distracting me from work.</p>
<p>I had a question about using MyST for blogging, but decided to look it up for myself. Then I was going to tweet it but got distracted by the thought that I needed more persistent record what with all the distraction.</p>
<p>The question I almost tweeted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there plugins or tools for using MyST to author blog posts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why yes there are! A quick search found these, and there are doubtless
other resources.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-myst">markdown-it-myst</a> for the <code>.js</code> blogs</li>
<li>A <a href="https://plugins.getnikola.com/v8/myst/">myst Nikola plugin</a> for the <code>.py</code> blogs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Could probably even use it in <a href="/card/hugo/">card/Hugo</a> if I make another <a href="/post/2021/08/trying-a-thing-with-neovim/">neovim plugin</a> for <code>.md.txt</code> files.</p>
<p>Anyways, time to refill the coffee and — flips past the Distraction Cards — work! Oh jeez yeah work.</p>
