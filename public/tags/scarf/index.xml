  <description>This is my version of the “Stripes (And Stripes) Forever Scarf” from Stitch ’N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker. It came together quickly. The only real challenge was getting the first row of single chains in.
Someday I’ll stick exactly to a pattern. Today is not that day. Here are the things I intentionally changed.
The pattern uses four colors, but I only had three I wanted to use for it I like longer scarves, so I added about six inches of length.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;I know it’s a silly name. See, I found a &lt;a href=&#34;http://doctorwhoscarf.com&#34;&gt;pattern site&lt;/a&gt; for scarves from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who&#34;&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt; TV show. &lt;a href=&#34;http://doctorwhoscarf.com&#34;&gt;http://doctorwhoscarf.com&lt;/a&gt; contains great patterns and solid advice throughout. This scarf uses the pattern for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doctorwhoscarf.com/s12.html&#34;&gt;original scarf&lt;/a&gt;, with some differences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<ul>
<li>I replaced the original scarf colors with an assortment of greens.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s only about 75% of the knitted rows from the pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>With those differences, it hardly seemed fair calling it a &ldquo;Doctor Who&rdquo; scarf.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Post: Quick Garter Stitch Scarf</title>

&lt;p&gt;I made a scarf for a friend. Nothing fancy, though the choice of soft, cozy &lt;a href=&#34;http://madelinetosh.com/store/index.php/yarns/tosh-merino.html&#34;&gt;Tosh Merino&lt;/a&gt; convinced her otherwise. She requested a long and skinny scarf. The finished product measures just over six feet long and four - wait, let me measure: &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; -  inches wide. I had enough yarn to go longer, but if she’s happy I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I made a scarf for a friend. Nothing fancy, though the choice of soft, cozy <a href="http://madelinetosh.com/store/index.php/yarns/tosh-merino.html">Tosh Merino</a> convinced her otherwise. She requested a long and skinny scarf. The finished product measures just over six feet long and four - wait, let me measure: <em>three</em> -  inches wide. I had enough yarn to go longer, but if she&rsquo;s happy I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>I followed the &ldquo;Loopy Garter Stitch Skinny Scarf&rdquo; instructions from this <a href="http://alison.knitsmiths.us/pattern_beginners_scarves.html">blue blog</a> patterns page, using size 13 needles. I never made fringe before, and found the <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Add-Fringe-to-a-Crochet-or-Knit-Project">wikiHow</a> instructions helpful.</p>
<p>There. Now I have a reference if somebody asks how I made that scarf, or I want to make another one like it. The blue blog patterns are handy for getting started. They were also handy for getting me back into practice. Sometimes you need to step back and do something simple when your yarn basket is full of ambitious works in progress. Gets the morale back up.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>Pretty much the only use this got was keeping me warm while typing in the middle of winter. It wasn’t attractive enough that anybody wanted to wear it in public.</description>

  <description>Started out Knitting the “maximum scarf” from the Knit Stitch book, but I got bored and went for a modified version of “Joel’s Scarf” instead. This is sport weight yarn, 60 stitch cast on, and and only 3 colors instead of 7. It has turned out to be my most popular scarf.</description>
