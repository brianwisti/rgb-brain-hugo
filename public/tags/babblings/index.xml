  <description>No, not the bra that provides appreciated support to countless women around the world.

I have been thinking about the slang word “bra,” which I already know is short for “brother” and used pretty much the same way I, as a West coast slacker, would use the word “dude.” First of all, I think it is a cool word and I would use it all the time if it didn’t sound so affected coming out of my lips.</description>

<p>I have been thinking about the slang word &ldquo;bra,&rdquo; which I already know is short for &ldquo;brother&rdquo; and used pretty much the same way I, as a West coast slacker, would use the word &ldquo;dude.&rdquo; First of all, I think it is a cool word and I would use it all the time if it didn’t sound so affected coming out of my lips. Second, where the heck did it start?</p>
<p>The first time I heard the word &ldquo;bra&rdquo; was watching <a href="http://www.dogthebountyhunter.com">Dog the Bounty Hunter</a> a couple of years ago. Why are you looking at me like that? I enjoy cheesy, semi-moralistic entertainment as much as the next guy. I figured &ldquo;bra&rdquo; was Hawaiian surfer slang and didn’t think much more about the word’s origin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>My TV close captioning and a couple of readers point out that the spelling for the Hawaiian version is &ldquo;brah.&rdquo; I’m on a roll, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last year I heard the term again, listening to <a href="https://song.link/i/1441133613">Ob La Di Ob La Da</a> by <a href="http://www.beatles.com">The
Beatles</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2010/09/attachments/img/2010/beatles-white-album.png" title="Pause for music" alt="cover of The Beatles White Album"/></p>
<p>I hadn’t listened to the song since before my exposure to Pacific Island bounty hunters, but this time the chorus jumped out at me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ob-la-di, ob-la-da,
Life goes on, bra</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course I missed it before. It was just one more nonsense word in a chorus consisting almost entirely of nonsense words. But now I am thinking of it as a word and there are a few things I’m suddenly driven to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that they really are singing &ldquo;bra&rdquo; and not something else.</li>
<li>Find out where this usage started!</li>
</ul>
<p>It was easy to confirm the lyrics. A few seconds at Google took me to
<a href="http://www.stevesbeatles.com/songs/ob_la_di_ob_la_da.asp">Steve’s Beatle Page</a>, which provided lyrics. The page also had some notes about the recording itself, like the fact that it was recorded in July of 1968. That is useful information. The earliest usage I’ve found so far is 1968, if I make the reasonable assumption that the Beatles meant &ldquo;bra&rdquo; the way I think they meant &ldquo;bra.&rdquo; It makes a little more sense than it being a nonsense word, and a lot more sense than the idea that they suddenly start blurting out the names of women’s undergarments like Jeff from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237123">Coupling</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s see if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra">Wikipedia</a> can provide anything useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bra&rdquo;, slang for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brother">Brother</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So … no. Wikipedia is not going to be helpful this time. Oh well, I wouldn’t have trusted the drunken wiki monkeys if they did have more information on the subject. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:bra">Google is having trouble, too.</a> The more common usage of &ldquo;bra&rdquo; refers to a breast support contraption, but I’m not worried about finding what I need to know. This will just take a couple of extra minutes to dig deeper into the Internet hive mind.</p>
<p>I thought I’d give <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com">Urban Dictionary</a> a try, but it’s worse than useless. One definition that especially bugs me is trying to tell me that &ldquo;bra&rdquo; is just like &ldquo;bro&rdquo; but pronounced different. No kidding. But <em>why</em> is it pronounced different? That curiosity is what’s driving my little search. The entry does have a grainy picture of an attractive bosom in a lovely pink brassiere, so I guess it wasn’t a complete waste.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to Google, this time looking for &ldquo;bra slang brother&rdquo;. South African slang is referred to a few times. This looks promising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>bru</em> - male friend (shortening of <em>broer</em> meaning brother, see also <em>bra</em> below); compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">American English</a>: &ldquo;dude&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>brah</em> - male friend (shortening of <em>brother</em>, se also <em>bru</em> above)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were on the Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_African_slang_words">African slang words</a> — maybe the drunken wiki monkeys could link from the bra disambiguation page to the South African slang page. The exact list is on a few other sites, but I can’t tell who is plagiarizing who.</p>
<p>I see that somebody else is on a similar quest, judging by a post on the
<a href="http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=481406">wordreference.com forums</a>. One of the posters there believes that the word is Hawaiian surfer slang that couldn’t have existed in 1967 — or 1968, as my info has shown me — or that Paul McCartney would not have been familiar with it if it did exist. I don’t think I agree with either assumption. Even if it was nothing more than Hawaiian surfer slang, it could have had its origins a long time ago. After all, <a href="http://www.coffeetimes.com/surf.htm">Hawaii</a> has been home to surfers for centuries, and to casual surfers since the 1800s. And the Beatles didn’t exactly spend all their days locked up in a
Liverpool basement.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;broer&rdquo; link is really tickling my curiosity. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4351402">BBC h2g2</a> is willing to put its foot down and say firmly that &ldquo;bra&rdquo; derives from the Afrikaans word &ldquo;broer&rdquo; and had its first usage in Cape Town. I love listening to people speaking Afrikaans or Dutch. So many of the words are similar to their English equivalents that my brain gets very frustrated that it can’t understand what is being said. Listening to Dutch as an English speaker is fairly similar to listening to English after you’ve had a night of intensely heavy drinking. You know the words - or you think you know the words - you just can’t make sense of what anyone is saying.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071212030749/http://www.wavescape.co.za/bot_bar/surfrikan/slang.html">listing of South African slang</a> suggests that the rolled &ldquo;r&rdquo; at the end of &ldquo;broer&rdquo; is too hard for lazy English speakers, and that’s how it got shortened to &ldquo;bru&rdquo; and &ldquo;bra.&rdquo; I can believe that. You should hear my attempts at speaking Spanish sometime. So at this point it looks like usage of &ldquo;bra&rdquo; as equivalent to &ldquo;bro&rdquo; or &ldquo;dude&rdquo; may have from somewhere in the area of Cape Town, South Africa. Or perhaps not.</p>
<p>What about that Beatles song? Well, this one should have been obvious to me from the start. Paul McCartney was grooving on the reggae! Jamaican <a href="http://www.desmonddekker.com/">Desmond Dekker</a>, considered by some to be the first reggae star, had recently released singles in England — <a href="https://song.link/i/1147768992">007 (Shanty Town)</a> in 1967, and <a href="https://song.link/i/1147769697">Israelites</a> in 1968 (although the hit version wasn’t released until 1969). There was at least one popular reggae track floating around in the ether while Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da was being written. In fact, the Desmond referred to in the song is none other than Desmond Dekker. I highly recommend listening to Dekker’s &ldquo;King of Ska&rdquo; if you can find the track. It is good stuff, and you can hear the influence he had on … pretty much every ska or reggae song that came after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bra&rdquo; is Jamaican slang for &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; according to the Dictionary of Jamaican English. It was first recorded in that form in 1943, which of course means that it could have been widespread in Jamaican slang by 1967-1968. Interestingly enough, &ldquo;bra&rdquo; is a shortened form of the Jamaican slang &ldquo;bro’er&rdquo; from 1907. &ldquo;Bro’er&rdquo; looks a lot like &ldquo;broer&rdquo;, but it apparently doesn’t have the same roots. Remember what I was saying before about Dutch/Afrikaans and English? I think this is a good example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bro’er&rdquo; might sound more familiar to Americans as &ldquo;Brer,&rdquo; as in <a href="http://www.americanfolklore.net/brer-rabbit.html">Brer Rabbit</a>. Brer Rabbit was the source of my favorite underdog stories as a small child. Oh. I’ve been pronouncing &ldquo;Brer&rdquo; wrong my whole life. First off, it’s supposed to be a shortened form of the English word &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; with the ending &ldquo;er&rdquo; sound softened dramatically — a Southern thing, I think. You end up with something sounding more like &ldquo;Bruh Rabbit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bra&rdquo; may in fact have split origins: one thread coming from the Southern US and Jamaica, and the other coming from South Africa.</p>
<p>The drunken monkeys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%27er_Rabbit">tell us</a> that the &ldquo;Brer&rdquo; in Brer Rabbit’s name came about due to a custom in many African cultures of people referring to each other as &ldquo;brother.&rdquo; I’m too tired now to verify this — which may be the ultimate source of Wikipedia’s power — but it’s a piece of trivia that amuses me. The character Desmond (probably not named after the King of Ska) in the show <a href="http://www.losttvshow.org">Lost</a> (filmed in Hawaii, home state of that endearingly scruffy bounty hunter of basic cable who says &ldquo;bra&rdquo; all the time) also has a habit of addressing everybody as &ldquo;brother&rdquo;. I love random connections.</p>
<p>I think that’s enough time spent exploring the origins of a single random slang term.</p>

  <description>Seattle is a city. It may not be as big as Los Angeles or New York, but it is still a city. You do not have an excuse to be bored, even if you are flat broke. My wife and I have lived in Seattle since 1999, and it still feels like we are scraping the surface of what this area has to offer after ten years.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>circa 2003, at least.</h2><p>Seattle is a city. It may not be as big as Los Angeles or New York, but it is still a city. You do not have an excuse to be bored, even if you are flat broke. My wife and I have lived in Seattle since 1999, and it still feels like we are scraping the surface of what this area has to
offer after ten years.</p>
<p>This page exists to guide folks around Seattle, with pointers to some trivia and favorite locations in town. You may find something new or forgotten in these pages. You might not agree with my opinions. That is okay. Go ahead and tell me all about it. Many ways to contact me are on the top of this page.</p>
<h2 id="seattle-neighborhoods">Seattle Neighborhoods</h2>
<p>Not all of them, obviously. Just a few that I’m more familiar with.</p>
<h3 id="skid-row">Skid Row</h3>
<p>You ever hear the term &ldquo;Skid Row&rdquo;? I’m told that phrase came from Seattle. Loggers used to skid logs down Yesler Way into the sawmill down near the waterfront. The street became sort of infamous for being where the worst of the city lived. 3rd and Yesler is still sort of the hairy armpit of the city, but there has been a lot of work to polish the street up. <a href="http://www.pioneersquare.org">Pioneer Square</a> is at the downtown end of Yesler. You won’t believe the amount of great food and music you can find around here. I’m trying to lose weight, so I avoid this neighborhood like the plague these days.</p>
<h3 id="fremont">Fremont</h3>
<p>Here’s a bit of trivia that will resolve a point of confusion for my dad when talking about Fremont. The neighborhood was named by its founders after the Nebraska town that they came from. These days, it’s a rapidly gentrifying — but still very active and artistic — spot in the northern part of Seattle. The people are nice, but maybe a little full of themselves sometimes. The shops are bright and fun to wander in. There’s no pressure to buy anything, but you’ll find good prices if you do feel like spending. Be smart about crossing the street, though. There have been more than a few accidents as people try to rush across against the crosswalk lights while some car is trying to rush through the yellow light. Don’t be paranoid, just be smart. That’s all I’m saying. And pay your respects to Lenin’s statue while you are in the neighborhood.</p>
<h3 id="phinney-ridge">Phinney Ridge</h3>
<p>Let me be honest. The only reason I know <em>anything</em> about Phinney Ridge is because we lived there for nearly four years. It is a gorgeous neighborhood at the very top of one of Seattle’s many hills. There are many expensive condos and older houses being remodeled by ambitious young families, but not much else.</p>
<p>Ha! Did you actually believe that? There’s not many shops here, but there’s still the <a href="http://www.zoo.org/">Woodland Park Zoo</a>! The sound of monkey loving late at night makes Phinney one of the most unusual city spots to live in. If you live in Seattle, you would be a fool not to get a membership to the zoo. It’s big. It’s beautiful. Membership is dirt cheap. You don’t even have to be big on animals. It’s nice to just come in and kick back for a relaxing bit of time on the grass.</p>
<p>As long as you’re in the neighborhood, you might as well walk up to Sully’s Snow Goose Tavern for a good pint of beer and a tasty veggie hot dog. I recommend their veggie dogs even if that is not normally your thing. They do have &ldquo;real&rdquo; hot dogs if you absolutely must have meat, but try the veggie version sometime. It’s good and tasty and leaves you wanting to ask if they’re <em>sure</em> that was the vegetarian version.</p>
<h3 id="central-district">Central District</h3>
<p>We have only explored the Central District a little, so I really only have one thing to tell you about: <a href="http://www.ezellschicken.com/">Ezell’s</a>. It’s the best danged fried chicken I have ever had. I’m getting hungry just thinking about it. Have you noticed that a lot of my neighborhood summaries mention food? Yeah, that’s how I’ve gone from being bone-skinny to needing to lose weight. Food in Seattle is really good and plentiful. You’ve been warned. Even <a href="http://www.oprah.com/index.html">Oprah Winfrey</a> has to be careful. Back in the day, she loved Ezell’s, gushed about it on TV, and the story claims that she even had their chicken specially delivered to Chicago. Yeah, I’d say it’s about that good. Be aware, though, the quality is a little inconsistent. It’s usually the best fried chicken ever, but occasionally they throw a dud so bad you wish you’d gone for grocery store deli chicken instead.</p>
<h3 id="international-district--chinatown">International District / Chinatown</h3>
<p>There is a minor identity crisis in this neighborhood. Some folks call it Chinatown, but it shows up on the map as the International District. Wander around a bit here. It’s nice. There are some great dim sum places, and <a href="http://www.uwajimaya.com/">Uwajimaya</a> is a fun store with lots and lots of great food for local families — and curious pasty white folk like me. I’m a big fan of the Kinokuniya book store, even though I can only read about a third of the titles. Someday I <em>will</em> learn Japanese, I swear!</p>
<h3 id="green-lake">Green Lake</h3>
<p>Joggers. That’s the first thing you notice when you visit this neighborhood. Bicyclists are probably the second. The last thing you notice will be either a jogger or a bicyclist, depending on who runs you down when you aren’t looking. You might notice a few things in between, though. The lake itself is pretty and well-maintained, with ducks and geese and an assortment of other urban wildlife varieties. There are a few good places to eat here, and at least one <a href="http://thecoffeerevolution.com/">great coffee shop</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the businesses in this neighborhood cater to the health-conscious sort of person: running supplies, bicycle shops, stuff like that. This obviously means that I haven’t been to half of the stores around me. As soon as they open a good shop for lazy computer geeks who like to knit, I’ll be there.</p>
<h2 id="so-long">So Long</h2>
<p>That’s it for the moment. Whenever I think of something else, I’ll add to this page. There is so much more that I would like to tell you about, but my typing fingers are already getting sore.</p>

<p>The events, individuals, and quotes in this story are based on actual events. They have been processed by a very muddled brain, however. It’s fair to say that this article — resulting as it does from bad notes and an even worse memory — is about <strong>this far</strong> from being a work of fiction.</p>
</aside>
<p>This thing is also deeply covered in my own opinions. If you see &ldquo;I&rdquo; or &ldquo;me&rdquo; then it is Brian’s opinion you’re reading. If you see an actual name, or &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;they&rdquo;, you know it’s John and / or Jeff.</p>
<h2 id="brian-finds-his-purpose">Brian Finds His Purpose</h2>
<p>Sometime on a damp February weekend in 2002,your Boldly Unemployed Web Programmer was drinking his coffee and reading up on the latest news from that fine site <a href="https://www.fark.com">Fark</a>. I came across an article discussing two Star Wars fans. Seems they’re waiting to see the next George Lucas movie &ldquo;Attack of the Clones&rdquo;, which was due to be released on May 16. In case you’re bad at math like me, that was about four months away. My first impression was that these were two of the sorriest individuals I had heard about since Junior High.</p>
<p>Then I thought about it a little more. The article was centered around a &ldquo;gift&rdquo; sent to the fans by a radio station in New York. What was the gift? A stripper. So while I was sitting here in my sweatpants, drinking coffee and making fun of them, these guys were setting a record and getting visited by strippers. It didn’t take long for me to realize which of us was the most pathetic.</p>
<p>Me. I meant me. Will you at least <strong>try</strong> to keep up?</p>
<p><img src="/post/2002/02/attachments/img/2002/stalk-004.jpg" alt="stalk 004"/></p>
<p>I read a little closer, and realized that these guys were sitting next to the Cinerama theater, in downtown Seattle! That’s about a 20 minute bus ride from where I live, and — well, it’s not like I was doing anything. Why not go downtown and interview them? I could bring my camera, get a tape recorder, and ask a few pointed questions, such as &ldquo;Is &lsquo;Attack of the Clones&rsquo; a stupid name?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Was the stripper really cute?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yes! Today, I had a purpose. No longer would my activity be limited to surfing the Web and scratching myself. Now I could go out and <strong>do</strong> something for the good of the online community! I knew that triumph would be mine.</p>
<p>So, with my mind made up and my coffeepot empty, I got dressed. Out into the world! First, I had to buy that tape recorder, since I am very very bad at taking notes. As long as I was at the store, I picked up a DVD copy of &ldquo;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace&rdquo;. Then was a brief stop back at home for this thing they call &ldquo;research&rdquo;. Who are these guys? What is their purpose? Is another stripper due today? Who is that really cute girl talking on her cell phone?</p>
<p><img src="/post/2002/02/attachments/img/2002/stalk-005.jpg" alt="stalk 005"/></p>
<p>Hmm … what? Interview? Oh yeah, that’s right. I got distracted.</p>
<p>I spent the next half-hour drinking 16 ounces of courage — with a little cream and sugar — working on the questions I would be asking these guys. I am normally a very quiet and reserved person, and I don’t usually do things like this unless I’m drunk. Even then, it’s too hard for me to think while drunk, so these things are still easy to avoid. There you have it folks: boredom is more dangerous than alcohol. Consider yourself warned.</p>
<p>As a last-ditch stalling effort, I tested my new tape recorder. It sucked. Unless the recorder was placed <strong>in</strong> their mouth during the interview, I could never decipher what’s being played on it. Crap. That meant I would have to take notes. I nearly backed down at this point, until I remembered that there was nothing else for me to do on this particular Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Muttering &ldquo;courage&rdquo; under my breath every step of the way, I walked the last few blocks to the Cinerama theater. There they were, sitting all snug and wrapped up in a Star Wars blanket. Lame? Maybe, but it was cold and starting to rain. At that point, I was thinking about stealing their Star Wars blanket for warmth — <strong>plus it’d make a nice trophy</strong>. My Purpose took over at that point. I stumbled up to them and stuttered out something clever, like &ldquo;Would you guys mind helping get some cheap publicity for my site with an interview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They seemed a little put off at first. That makes sense. Some stranger walks up out of nowhere and wants to interview you? At this point, they could have said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I would have gone back home, and written a much shorter article. No complaints. Well, not many.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, they rejected their good judgement and agreed to the &ldquo;interview&rdquo;. As I said, my tape recorder was a lemon, so we won’t have the classic &ldquo;Question:Answer&rdquo; style normally used in interviews. I’ll just go over my notes and try to make sense of them.</p>
<p>To be certain of the best answers, I made them swear on my DVD copy of &ldquo;The Phantom Menace&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, unless a lie would be more entertaining, so help you Lucas?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They both swore, and the interview had begun.</p>
<h2 id="waiting-for-star-wars">Waiting For Star Wars</h2>
<p>The two fans in question are Jeff Tweiten and John Guth. According to my copious notes — <strong>humor me</strong> — Jeff is &ldquo;the hat&rdquo;, and John is &ldquo;orange.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="/post/2002/02/attachments/img/2002/stalk-010.jpg" alt="Jeff and John"/></p>
<p>They are both members of the Seattle Star Wars Society. What is their motivation? Well, I didn’t think to ask, so here’s a quote from the Seattle Star Wars Society front page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Waiting for Star Wars is an art project designed to capture the evolution and journey of waiting for a single event (Star Wars Episode II). It will be captured by time-indexed photographs taken every hour as well as pictures and video of the people we interact with.</p>
<p>This project also explores the issue of the pursuit of happiness. It asks how much will a person sacrifice for a temporary acquisition, and questions whether a person can be happy with just food and shelter in pursuit of that acquisition. It also asks, will society as a whole fear or accept people for not desiring the things they desire, or for desiring things they consider frivolous or ridiculous. Finally, as we move into the next millennium, I wonder if our fast-paced society has become unwilling to slow down and wait for the things that bring us the greatest joy. This wait will test our mettle as we attempt to do
just that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First order of business: the Jar-Jar Binks controversy. Was his existence a stain on the Star Wars Universe?</p>
<p>Jeff took this one, while John typed away on his laptop. &ldquo;It was Bill Clinton who said &lsquo;Don’t pass judgement on Jar-Jar&rsquo; …&rdquo; — and then my notes are all smudged by the Seattle rain. He said he was quoting <a href="http://www.theonion.com">The Onion</a>, but I haven’t been able to find any references at that site. <strong>…​ sigh …​</strong> Ah well. If you folks wanted hard hitting journalism, you should have gone to <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a>, or maybe <a href="https://www.fark.com">Fark</a>. Hell, you’d probably have better luck reading Garfield!</p>
<p>To my surprise, they were both employed. In fact, the reason for John’s quiet behavior was the fact that he was working from his laptop while they were sitting there on the sidewalk talking to strangers. They have jobs <strong>and</strong> they can sit on their butts for 4 1/2 months? Lucky bastards! On the other hand, my unemployment means that I can follow a random whim and interview strange people in the middle of the afternoon.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2002/02/attachments/img/2002/stalk-009.jpg" alt="John"/></p>
<p>I know that I get bothered after being in line for 15 minutes and somebody sees fit to try and get ahead of me. How would it feel if you’ve been sitting there for, say, 3 months, and some guy sits next to you for the next month and a half and steals your spot? John looked up from his work long enough to mumble something that sounded painful and involved genital mutilation. So don’t cut in front of John. Ever. Jeff’s reply was a little less direct, but still ominous: &ldquo;We do have our own brute squad, trained in Jedi ways.&rdquo; I’m not sure if the brute squad would break your kneecaps or just try to convince you that this is not the movie you’re looking for. I leave it up to your own judgment whether the risk is worth the reward.</p>
<p>The other rule stands, though. Don’t cut in front of John. Ever.</p>
<p>Their efforts have resulted in some pretty intense name-calling on the Internet. I admit that I took some small part in it before thinking about the whole &ldquo;they meet a stripper while I pick my nose&rdquo; issue. The few tame comments tossed out by me truly pale in comparison to the slings and arrows to be found on the Seattle Star Wars discussion board. What about the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;? Do they get strange people coming up off the street and harassing them? Besides me, of course.</p>
<p>They have gotten a little bit of flak every once in a while, but Jeff has been called worse while jaywalking. You could tell by the looks on both of their faces that it was not an issue, and had not affected their mission at all.</p>
<p>A few people online even had harsh words for the stripper that visited them, calling her &ldquo;butterface&rdquo; — &ldquo;She’s cute, <em>but her face</em>!&rdquo;. I know how deceptive the camera can be. For example, I’m 6 foot tall, packed with 240 pounds of muscle, bearing chiseled good looks and a winning smile. Yet somehow the camera always shows me as around 5 foot 6 inches, kinda pasty, and a little goofy-looking. So what about it? Did the stripper have butterface?</p>
<p>Both John and Jeff seemed a little startled by the question, like it was something that hadn’t even occurred to them. Jeff started a line of argument that began &ldquo;I’ve seen uglier strippers&rdquo;, but thought better of it and changed tactics. They both agreed that the stripper was quite attractive — &ldquo;very cute&rdquo; — and theorized that the people who were making these comments were the same folks who would paste Natalie Portman’s face on the stripper’s body. I wish I’d thought to ask the lady’s name, but we shall have to call her Nice Stripper Lady. Nice Stripper Lady, I salute you and your efforts to bring sunshine to the lives of these dedicated fans!</p>
<h2 id="when-fanboys-collide">When Fanboys Collide</h2>
<p>Enough about them and Nice Stripper Lady. Let’s discuss the Star Wars movies. Before we go further, I have to confess to you, Dear Reader, that I was one of &ldquo;those guys&rdquo;. I saw Star Wars as a kid 13 or 14 times in the theater, and countless times on cable or video. There was the mountain of action figures, my discovery and interpretation of Taoism in terms of The Force, and I learned my grammar from Yoda, I did. Even though I’m not as dedicated as I once was — I eventually decided girls were cuter than ewoks — there’s still a bit of the fanboy in me. I will see each of the new Star Wars movies in the theater, whether they suck or not, simply because I am going to Hell if I don’t. So while I don’t have the fanaticism of John and Jeff, I felt like we could talk shop about Star Wars.</p>
<p>Despite being a fanboy, or maybe because of it, I was disappointed by &ldquo;The Phantom Menace&rdquo;. The kids around me were getting a thrill very similar to what I had upon first seeing Star Wars, but it just left me empty. I wanted to know if I was the only one, or if others felt this way. Are the movies getting better, worse, or maintaining some cosmic consistency?</p>
<p><img src="/post/2002/02/attachments/img/2002/stalk-008.jpg" alt="Jeff"/></p>
<p>This was obviously a dilemma, and I could tell that they had chewed over it themselves. Finally, Jeff declared that &ldquo;The Phantom Menace&rdquo; suffered from the fact that it had been 14 years since the last Star Wars movie, and Lucas could have trimmed quite a bit of the &ldquo;fat&rdquo; and ended up with a better film. Still, they’d heard some good things about the &ldquo;Attack of the Clones&rdquo; movie, so the final decision was that the saga was maintaining consistency. I hope so, but time will be the final judge of that.</p>
<p>There was another issue for me: the movie titles. &ldquo;The Phantom Menace&rdquo;? &ldquo;Attack of the Clones&rdquo;? It seemed to me that Lucas was getting his ideas from rejected titles of 1950’s B-grade sci-fi. What did these guys think of the names?</p>
<p>John shared that he had been initially unhappy with the title &ldquo;The Phantom Menace&rdquo;, but it had grown on him over the years. That seemed unlikely with &ldquo;Attack of the Clones&rdquo; — which I keep mispronouncing as &ldquo;Attack of the Clowns.&rdquo; He felt that &ldquo;Clone Wars&rdquo; would have been a much more effective title. Personally, I think it was rejected by the marketing department because &ldquo;Star Wars: Clone Wars&rdquo; might have confused stupid people.</p>
<p>At this point, I realized that there had been too much of a focus on the negative aspects of the movies. It was time for some positive feedback. What about Ewan MacGregor’s Obi-Wan accent — did it kick ass or what? Personally, I think that the quality of his performance reflected quite nicely on his acting abilities. Of course he’s done better in other movies, but this is <em>Star Wars</em>. It’s not high art or anything like that. Plus it’s cool that Ewan’s uncle played the longest-lived bit part in the original trilogy, Wedge Antilles. Wedge was one of my favorite characters, simply by virtue of surviving through the whole thing without being laden with The Force, rakish charm, or Muppet Invulnerability that saved all the main characters.</p>
<p>Jeff had &ldquo;no problem&rdquo; with it. He obviously did not share my unhealthy fascination for Mr. MacGregor. John was a little more forthcoming, and stated that it worked very well and he could believe that he was looking at a young Alec Guiness on the screen.</p>
<p>Cover your eyes, kids, this question is about the darker side of a fan’s love for a movie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Princess Leia or Queen Amidahla?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a split decision, with Jeff choosing Queen Amidahla and John choosing Princess Leia. John was confused at first, thinking that I was asking which he would prefer to have as a sister. I felt really dirty when explaining to him that I meant in a sick-geek-fantasy sort of way. I was also suddenly aware of all the 10 year olds standing in line waiting to see &ldquo;Fellowship of the Ring&rdquo;. Hopefully I won’t go to Hell for that one.</p>
<h2 id="a-hard-rains-gonna-fall">A Hard Rain’s Gonna Fall</h2>
<p>They were obviously determined to stay firmly planted where they were, no matter the cost. Personally, I was almost ready to leave because of steadily increasing rainfall. I had to find out what might get <strong>them</strong> out of the line. What would it be? Offers of sex? Another big Seattle earthquake? Perhaps an alien invasion?</p>
<p>Of the options given, they both agreed that an alien invasion would probably get them to re-evaluate their mission. However, they also felt the need to add one: a $10,000 donation to the Seattle Star Wars Junior Jedi Program, which is a charity for needy children. So there you go, folks. If you get tired of hearing about John and Jeff, and have $10,000 handy — or can find 10,000 people with $1.00 perhaps — you can get them off the streets.</p>
<p>Until Episode 3, anyways.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2002/02/attachments/img/2002/stalk-011.jpg" alt="Posing with John and Jeff"/></p>
<p>They had mentioned setting a record. I was wondering if they were expecting any money from the <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/">Guinness</a> people for their hard work. Not only were they not expecting that sort of reward, but if they got it, it would go to charity. Ah, how the employed can afford to be generous.</p>
<p>No idea what would happen if the <a href="https://www.guinness.com/">other Guinness</a> people showed up.</p>
<p>If you hadn’t guessed by this point, I am an odd person. I felt bad that these nice guys were getting such harsh words from people who thought they were stupid geeks doing a pointless thing. So, to protect them from those who would say that <strong>they</strong> were the saddest humans on the planet, I asked for their autograph.</p>
<p>Yes. I asked for the autographs of two guys whose only claim to fame is sitting for 4 1/2 months waiting to see a Star Wars movie with a horrible name. And I got it! They signed my specially-purchased &ldquo;Phantom Menace&rdquo; DVD, and it will sit in my movie collection to show to the neighbors&rsquo; grandchildren. I’d show it to my grandchildren, but what do you think the odds are at this point that I’m ever going to get that lucky?</p>
<p>I was out of questions and it was starting to really rain — as opposed to the ordinary rain we get the rest of the time in Seattle. A nice yet somewhat bemused lady took our picture. She had witnessed most of the interview, and was apparently having trouble trying to decide which of us was in more desperate need of a life: the guys waiting for the movie, or the guy who comes down for their autograph. Still, I think we made her day.</p>
<p>Closer examination of the photo reveals that some other people were pretty amused by the whole exchange.</p>
<p>To thank them for their time, I ran across the street to Ralph’s Grocery, and fetched some Gatorade and American Spirit cigarettes. We shook hands, I wished them luck, and starting trudging back to the bus stop.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2002/02/attachments/img/2002/stalk-013.jpg" alt="wet"/></p>
<p>I was cold. I was wet. My butt was cold and wet. I just wanted to be home where there was a roof, coffee, and a computer. After a period of time that amounted to &ldquo;too long&rdquo;, the bus showed up, and I dragged my drenched self to my apartment. My Purpose had been fulfilled. All that remained was to type it up and post it on the site.</p>
<p>I’d like to take this moment to thank John Guth and Jeff Tweiten for humoring someone who could easily have been a dangerous psychopath.</p>
<p>What do I say now? &ldquo;May The Force Be With You?&rdquo; Sure, that’ll work. Now where did I put my coffee?</p>
