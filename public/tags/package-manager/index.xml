  <description>Just updated PowerShell via winget, Microsoft’s command line package manager. And Firefox. And Volta. And HeidiSQL. And Alacritty. And Go. And some other stuff.
Trying to recover a post about markdown-it-py that I accidentally deleted, so I won’t sidetrack myself with a detailed follow-up on the last time I really looked at winget.
Instead, here’s the card/TIL:
winget upgrade shows what’s out of date winget upgrade --id=&lt;package.id&gt; upgrades a package winget upgrade --all upgrades everything.</description>

<p>No &ldquo;Run As Administrator&rdquo; needed, though you need to click the <abbr title="User Access Control">UAC</abbr> dialog. Another caveat: it&rsquo;s coming from the application&rsquo;s own download servers, not some Azure-backed central repository. Sometimes the fetching may take a minute.</p>

  <description>winget is a command line package manager for inbox/Windows 10, open-sourced under the MIT License. Roughly equivalent to apt or brew. If you already know and love Chocolatey, you’re fine. Stick with that for now. winget shows promise though.
The other night I installed Strawberry Perl and played with Image::ExifTool a tiny bit.
Yesterday I successfully installed Emacs and started doing real work writing Perl code with it.
Exciting!
Well, not work work.</description>

<p>Well, not <em>work</em> work. The new job doesn’t start until tomorrow, and is mostly Python.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-winget">How do I get Winget?</h2>
<p><code>winget</code> is still in preview.  You can get it as part of the <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">Windows Insider</a> program, like me.  Slow Ring should be fine.  If you don’t feel like taking the risk on a preview release of Windows, you can grab it from the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli">winget-cli repository</a>.</p>

<p>One goal when in Windows is to <em>use</em> Windows, and not just spend all day hiding
in WSL.  If I want to use Windows, I need <a href="/card/perl/">card/Perl</a>.</p>
<p>Hey, I’ll allow myself a few crutches here and there.</p>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I had a pleasant Saturday. It started with an hour or so of the Coursera &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang/&#34;&gt;Programming Languages&lt;/a&gt; videos. I learned a little bit about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smlnj.org/&#34;&gt;SML&lt;/a&gt;, and have been trying to remember the instructor’s caution about comparing what’s learned in class to other languages. It’s supposed to be a fresh perspective on programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A package manager for Windows</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I had a pleasant Saturday. It started with an hour or so of the Coursera <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang/">Programming Languages</a> videos. I learned a little bit about <a href="http://www.smlnj.org/">SML</a>, and have been trying to remember the instructor&rsquo;s caution about comparing what&rsquo;s learned in class to other languages. It&rsquo;s supposed to be a fresh perspective on programming.</p>
<p>Some time in the evening was spent playing Torchlight 2 and fiddling with things on the Windows partition of my machine.</p>
<p>Recently I have been spending more time in <em>inbox/Windows</em>. I don&rsquo;t really know why. Could just be a seasonal thing. Every few months I get bored of the tools and languages I&rsquo;m using, and start looking for new combinations. Most of the Free and Open Source Software that I enjoy is available on any operating system I feel like using, so it isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> big of a deal.</p>
<p>Sometimes I discover something completely new to me when I do these switches. One of my discoveries this time around on Windows is <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">chocolatey</a>. chocolatey is a package manager for Windows. It allows you to install a surprising range of software utilities from an administrative command line - <code>cmd.exe</code> or PowerShell will work.</p>
<p>According to their front page, there are currently 2,257 unique packages available in the chocolatey system. There are plenty of expected FOSS tools such as editors and programming languages. There are also many utilities that I always end up installing on Windows, like <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/paint.net/">Paint.NET</a> and <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/putty/">PuTTY</a>.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t find chocolatey until after installing my core Python and Perl toolset, but both are available. <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/python/">Here&rsquo;s Python</a> and <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/StrawberryPerl/">Here&rsquo;s Perl</a>. It looks like the version of Strawberry Perl in chocolately is a little behind, so it probably helps to pay attention to available versions.</p>
<p><a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/ruby/">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/Emacs/">Emacs</a> are installed via chocolatey, though. I definitely want to spend some more time with chocolatey. It seems quite nice at first glance.</p>]]></content:encoded>
