  <description>Random post crossed into my field of view today.
{% quote( from=“OnePub” title=“The threat that chat-gpt3 poses to bloggers” cite=&#34;https://onepub.dev/Blog?id=jxbxpsdavu&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=blog&#34; ) %}
When one day someone asks Chat-gpt3 - ‘how is chat-gpt3 like a Wasp Spider’, chat-gpt3 will quote my article (because who else would make such ridiculous analogies) without attribution.
But what it won’t do is offer the user a link to the source of the information and it will never result in a user visiting the OnePub blog.</description>

<p>&ldquo;I made this&rdquo; is one of the oldest frustrations of the Internet, to the point of being immortalized in comic form at least <a href="https://nedroidcomics.tumblr.com/post/41879001445/the-internet">once</a>. Heck it&rsquo;s part of why I set my site content to a Creative Commons license. Why fight it? But yeah. Any possible external value has been extracted and claimed. Let&rsquo;s assume it&rsquo;s too late for my ancient blog.</p>
<p>Your newer site, with words and images you care deeply about? You may want to put some locks on those doors.</p>
<p>The only caveat about the advice from the article — aside from the fact that it&rsquo;s probably kinda satirical what with getting its answers <em>from</em> chat-GPT3:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>robots.txt</code> is usually ignored &mdash; but it&rsquo;s still a nice gesture to the few who acknowledge it</li>
<li>User-agent restrictions can be worked around with minimal effort &mdash; but will work against the large number of folks who can&rsquo;t be bothered with minimal effort</li>
</ul>

  <description>Thirty seconds to add a bookmark link. Three hours to tweak a bunch of minor layout issues.
I’m like a machine. A machine held together by duct tape and glitter glue.</description>
