  <description>That thing where you’re doing a thing but need to look up something and get an idea and start a thing but need a thing and you notice a thing and get an idea and start a thing and you notice a thing…
Is that an card/ADHD thing? That sounds like an ADHD thing.</description>

  <description>me as a young goofy man in 2000 or so
Twenty years ago — give or take a couple weeks — I started working as a backend programmer in tech writing card/Perl code for a real live paycheck, as opposed to designing sites for cigarette money from local ISPs.
About six months later the outer layers of the dot-com bubble frayed and I experienced my first layoff. Couple recessions and a few mental breakdowns later, I’m still at it!</description>

me as a young goofy man in 2000 or so</p>
<p>Twenty years ago — give or take a couple weeks — I started working as a  backend programmer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001018153353/http://www.cmiworldwide.com/">in tech</a> writing <a href="/card/perl/">card/Perl</a> code for a real live paycheck, as opposed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980703072855/http://www.plazma.net/">designing sites</a> for cigarette money from <a href="http://l7.net/">local ISPs</a>.</p>
<p>About six months later the outer layers of the <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/an-eye-opening-look-at-the-dot-com-bubble-of-2000-and-how-it-shapes-our-lives-today/">dot-com bubble</a> frayed and I experienced my first layoff. Couple recessions and a few mental breakdowns later, I&rsquo;m still at it!</p>
<p>I have no deep thoughts on the subject. I still like writing code, even when I hate it. I also enjoy eating. Being a programmer has made both these things easier.</p>
