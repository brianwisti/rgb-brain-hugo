  <title>Post: Officially Using Statamic For The Site</title>

  <description>Hey look it’s a Web page, but with Statamic!
Got the Webmention pingbacks up. Got the Plausible token in place. Got server configuration and deployment working.
Got — server configuration? Well yeah. The card/Statamic CMS runs on card/PHP. I could generate and push a static site with it, but I want to try some card/Laravel stuff. Been watching Laracasts even.
What’s different? The visual style, obviously. But I cycle through those routinely.</description>

Hey look it&rsquo;s a Web page, but with Statamic!</p>
<p>Got the <a href="https://webmention.io">Webmention</a> pingbacks up.  Got the <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible</a> token in place.  Got server configuration and deployment working.</p>
<p>Got — server configuration?  Well yeah.  The <a href="/card/statamic/">card/Statamic</a> CMS runs on <a href="/card/php/">card/PHP</a>.  I <em>could</em> generate and push a static site with it, but I want to try some <a href="/card/laravel/">card/Laravel</a> stuff.  Been watching <a href="https://laracasts.com/">Laracasts</a> even.</p>
<h2 id="whats-different">What’s different?</h2>
<p>The visual style, obviously.  But I cycle through those routinely.  This one’s <a href="https://www.getpapercss.com/">PaperCSS</a> with a few tweaks.</p>
<p>I added a new section for my art — specifically for the art you can buy somewhere.  That’s been on my task list for a long time.  Feels nice to get it out of the way.  I have a sizable backlog of stuff I wanted to put on my <a href="https://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/randomgeek/">store</a>.  That art section will remind me to get through that backlog a bit more quickly.</p>
<p>You can search! Just by title or tag for now, but I’ll add more as I figure out how to fine tune it. And because you can search, I’m not <em>as</em> worried about how pagination is handled. I’m sure I’ll add something later.</p>
<p>And also because you can search, I haven’t gotten to the page aliases yet. Lots of broken inbound links, I expect. If this were some kind of professional site, I would’ve waited until I had those in place. But it’s not. So I don’t.</p>
<h2 id="anything-else">Anything else?</h2>
<p>From your perspective, that’s about it.  It’s pretty much the same site.</p>
<p>From my perspective, so much!  I get an awesome control panel to manage and edit content.  All my pages are still in flat text files, so I can edit them in my favorite text editor with no fuss.</p>
<p>Okay that’s not new for the site.  It’s new compared to when I tried this with WordPress though.</p>
<h2 id="whats-different-from-stock-statamic-solo">What’s different from stock Statamic Solo?</h2>
<p>The styling is set up with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> instead of the starter’s default of <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>.  Probably shift back once I figure out an approach to content styling that I prefer to Tailwind Prose.</p>
<p>I don’t entirely trust server-side for a blog.  Nothing to do with Statamic or PHP mind you.  It’s just too easy to miss important details when you’re running a solo project.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I added <a href="https://statamic.com/addons/jrc9designstudio/2fa">2FA</a> for two factor authentication and <a href="https://statamic.com/addons/simonhamp/gitamic">Gitamic</a> for Git integration.  Both are paid add-ons.  Much as I love open source software, I love knowing that good developers get a good dinner even more.  Sponsorship and patronage only go so far — on my monthly budget, at least.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>There’s still some basic deployment stuff to figure out.  Metadata for sharing, or what the boring kids call &ldquo;SEO.&rdquo; Ugh.  I ain’t optimizing <em>nothin’</em>, least of all some search engine’s job.</p>
<p>Anyways.  Then comes automating the non-RSS syndication: posting toots and tweets when I hit &ldquo;Publish.&rdquo; Until I get that code in it’s manual, so I’ll probably skip those for my notes.</p>
<p>After that?  Watch Laracasts.  Learn Laravel.  Learn Statamic.  Have fun.</p>

  <title>Post: Shaved 3 Seconds Off Site Build Time!</title>

  <description>And I spent two days doing it. So let’s see. If I somehow post every day, that work should pay off somewhere around — counts on fingers — 2026?
Okay I did other stuff besides micro-optimization, but still. I am amused.</description>
