  <description>output of my custom task top report
It happened again. I have a couple dozen great ideas for the blog. Loads of other things I need to get at as well. So yeah. I got myself a little overwhelmed, and I need to stop and get a solid idea of the top tasks: the ones I want to be working on now or soon.
I’ve been dutifully adding everything to Taskwarrior, assigning priorities as I go.</description>

output of my custom <code>task top</code> report</p>
<p>It happened again. I have a couple dozen great ideas for the blog. Loads of other things I need to get at as well. So yeah. I got myself a little overwhelmed, and I need to stop and get a solid idea of the top tasks: the ones I want to be working on now or soon.</p>
<p>I’ve been dutifully adding everything to Taskwarrior, assigning
<a href="/post/2017/12/taskwarrior-priorities/">priorities</a> as I go.</p>
<p>In case you forgot, or haven’t been following from the <a href="/post/2017/12/taskwarrior/">beginning</a>, I use <a href="/card/taskwarrior/">card/Taskwarrior</a>’s <code>Priority</code> field to show how soon I want to work on a task. <code>Priority:M</code>? I want to work on it soon. <code>Priority:H</code>? Either I am working on it right now or I really want to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] Yeah I know
Taskwarrior lets you assign <a href="/post/2018/01/taskwarrior-due-dates/">due dates</a> and <a href="/post/2018/02/setting-task-dependencies-in-taskwarrior/">dependencies</a>. Tasks that are due or that block something else get higher <code>Urgency</code>, and bubble to the top of reports. For some folks, that works great.</p>
<p>For me? They mostly lead to heartbreak and self-recrimination. I refer you to these words of wisdom from a greater mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.</p>
<p>— Douglas Adams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get more done quicker by flagging a few tasks as important, a few more tasks as less important, and the rest as &ldquo;whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I still use [[post/2018/12/active-tasks-in-taskwarrior|<code>start</code>]] to remember what I’m doing right now though. I’m not completely weird.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time for me to figure out <code>or</code> in Taskwarrior.</p>
<h2 id="filtering-with-or">Filtering with <code>or</code></h2>
<p>Filters already have an implied <code>and</code>. It looks like this.</p>
<p>How many active tasks do I have?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task +PENDING count
198
</code></pre><p>How many active tasks do I want to work on soon?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task +PENDING priority:M count
28
</code></pre><p>That’s filtering tasks to those for which <code>+PENDING</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>priority:M</code> are true.</p>
<p>How many active tasks do I want to be working on now?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task +PENDING priority:H count
6
</code></pre><p>That’s a bit much. It should be more like four or five.</p>
<p>How many active tasks do I want to work on now or soon? That is, which tasks are <code>+PENDING</code> and have either <code>priority:M</code> or <code>priority:H</code>?</p>
<p>We can use <code>or</code> to join two filters. If either of them is true for the task, that task is included. Use parentheses to build more complex filters.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task +PENDING (priority:H or priority:M) count
zsh: unknown file attribute: i
</code></pre><p>Tada — oops. Hang on. This stuff goes through the shell before it reaches Taskwarrior. Let’s put the filter in a string.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task &#39;+PENDING (priority:H or priority:M)&#39; count
34
</code></pre><p>Tada!</p>
<p>Okay, it works, but I just know there will be more typos using this filter from memory. How can I avoid typing it in every time?</p>
<h2 id="use-a-context">Use a context</h2>
<p>I could add that priority filter to my &ldquo;focused&rdquo; <a href="/post/2018/02/taskwarrior-contexts/">context</a>, used when I need to ignore distracting ideas.</p>
<p><strong><code>~/.taskrc</code></strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>context.focused=-idea -shelved (priority:H or priority:M)
</code></pre><p>Now <em>every</em> report skips low priority tasks.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context focused
Context &#39;focused&#39; set. Use &#39;task context none&#39; to remove.
$ task +PENDING count
34
</code></pre><p>This is great, but I want to know my top tasks even when I’m not in focused context.</p>
<p>Plus it’s easy to forget which context you’re in. I once spent 15 minutes trying to find a <code>+work</code> task before remembering I was still in <code>offwork</code> context. Which reminds me — </p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context blog
</code></pre><h2 id="use-a-shell-alias">Use a shell alias</h2>
<p>Part of Taskwarrior’s charm is the fact that we use <code>task</code> from the command line. I could take advantage of that with a shell alias for <code>task</code> using the preface filter.</p>
<p><strong><code>~/.aliases</code></strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">alias</span> <span class="nv">ttop</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;task +PENDING &#34;(priority:H or priority:M)&#34;&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This gives me sort of an on-the-fly context.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ ttop count
34
</code></pre><p>I could use <code>ttop</code> with any Taskwarrior command, so <code>ttop next</code> would be a fine way to look at my important tasks.</p>
<p>But I’d kind of like to have a custom report for reviewing tasks I’ve set as important. Something with a little more information than <code>task minimal</code> but a bit less than <code>task next</code>.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-custom-report">Use a custom report</h2>
<p>Might be easier to show than tell. For more of a &ldquo;tell&rdquo; approach, check the &ldquo;REPORTS&rdquo; section of <code>man taskrc</code>. Here’s my custom &ldquo;top&rdquo; report, loosely based on Taskwarrior’s <code>minimal</code> report.</p>
<p><strong><code>~/.taskrc</code></strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl"># Almost-minimal view of tasks I want to work on most
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">report.top.columns=id,priority,project,tags,description.count 
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">report.top.description=&#39;Minimal details of tasks&#39;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">report.top.filter=status:pending (priority:H or priority:M)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">report.top.labels=ID,Pri,Project,Tags,Description
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">report.top.sort=priority-/,project-,description+ 
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>
<p><code>description.count</code> column is used for the description text and the number of annotations for the task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sort</code> specifies columns to sort by, in descending or ascending order. <code>priority-/</code> means “descending, dividing each block of priorities with a  blank row.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s what my <code>top</code> report looks like.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task top

  <description>inthe.AM is pretty, that’s for sure.
[!WARNING] 2024-01-14 This post no longer works as-is. Freecinc and InThe.AM have both shut down. Their efforts all these years have been appreciated!
The problem You’ve been doing great with your Taskwarrior tasks. You tag them. You collect them into projects. You set priorities and due dates. Maybe you even track blockers and active tasks.
Everything’s great until the day you need to get at your tasks on a different machine: laptop, work computer, whatever.</description>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>You’ve been doing great with your <a href="/card/taskwarrior/">Taskwarrior</a> tasks. You tag them. You collect them into projects. You set priorities and due dates. Maybe you even track blockers and active tasks.</p>
<p>Everything’s great until the day you need to get at your tasks on a different machine: laptop, work computer, whatever.</p>
<p>How do you get at your carefully maintained task list from another machine?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] Why not just use your phone?
Well, the mobile Taskwarrior experience is not great. There are a couple Android apps, but they lack the polish of other mobile task managers. So far I haven’t seen anything for iOS except a couple seemingly abandoned projects. You <em>could</em> use the mobile web interface for <code>inthe.AM</code>. Some folks type in <code>task</code> commands through a mobile terminal emulator like <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a>.</p>
<p>Me? Mostly I take notes when out and about. Sometimes those notes become tasks when I’m in front of a computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-solution-taskservers">A solution: taskservers</h2>
<p>Technically, you could keep your task files on a shared folder like <code>Sync/</code>, <code>Dropbox/</code>. I do not recommend it. Eventually your task management gets ahead of folder synchronization. Now you’re sorting out file conflicts.</p>
<p>Taskwarrior provides a better solution with <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/why.html">taskservers</a>. Taskservers manage the details of accessing the task list. They help you avoid file conflicts, and — even better — give you a backup of your task history.</p>
<h3 id="run-your-own-task-server">Run your own task server</h3>
<p>I’ve done this. It’s fiddly. Not impossible. Just fiddly. Anyone who wants to host their own taskserver should just play along with <a href="https://gitpitch.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskserver-setup#/">this slide deck</a>. It provides explicit and careful instructions for setup.</p>
<p>I also suggest you put the taskserver on a host or VPS — something you can reach from outside your home. I put mine on a Raspberry Pi at home, but never exposed it to the outside world. Made it difficult to stay properly synchronized.</p>
<h3 id="hosted-taskservers">Hosted taskservers</h3>
<p>They did the hard work of setting up a taskserver, and made it easy for you to connect. Hosted taskservers are easy to reach anywhere you have Internet access.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a copy of your data is on someone else’s server. If you want total control, you may want to go ahead and run your own.</p>
<p>I’m comfortable with hosted services, so let’s look at a couple I’ve tried.</p>
<h4 id="freecinc">Freecinc</h4>
<p><img src="/post/2020/01/attachments/img/2020/freecinc.png" alt="freecinc.com"/></p>
<p>Freecinc seems to have one goal: make it easy to connect to a taskserver. There are no frills or extra features. It only serves tasks. But it does that well, with clear and friendly instructions on setting yourself up. Depending on how long it takes you to click, copy, and paste, you could be synchronizing tasks in under a minute. Freecinc is also open source. <a href="https://github.com/freecinc/freecinc-web">freecinc-web</a> is available under the <a href="https://github.com/freecinc/freecinc-web/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT License</a>. Clone the repo and deploy your own instance!</p>
<p>Though yeah — that’s a bit more involved than just connecting to theirs.</p>
<h4 id="intheam">inthe.AM</h4>
<p><img src="/post/2020/01/attachments/img/2020/inthe-am.png" alt="inthe.AM Web interface"/></p>
<p><code>inthe.AM</code> provides features, that’s for sure. You get task synchronization. Like Freecinc, it provides a hosted taskserver and makes the <a href="https://github.com/coddingtonbear/inthe.am">source code</a> available, using GNU’s <a href="https://github.com/coddingtonbear/inthe.am/blob/development/LICENSE">AGPL license</a>. You get a decent — if occasionally sluggish — Web interface. You get <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> integration. You get <a href="https://github.com/coddingtonbear/taskwarrior-inthe.am">taskwarrior-inthe.am</a>, a helpful command line setup tool.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020/01/attachments/img/2020/inthe-am-trello.png" alt="Trello showing my active tasks"/></p>
<p>This is fantastic if you use those features. I have not. For my usage style, Freecinc and inthe.AM are pretty much the same.</p>
<h2 id="using-task-sync">Using <code>task sync</code></h2>
<p>Since I’m not really using inthe.AM’s features, let’s set myself up on Freecinc. I click the big friendly &ldquo;Generate My Keys&rdquo; link, and the site tells me what to do.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020/01/attachments/img/2020/freecinc-setup.png" alt="The first couple steps of Freecinc setup"/></p>
<p>There are six total steps, consistently almost entirely of downloading some small files and copying and pasting some commands. Once the <code>.pem</code> files are safe and I set the <code>taskd</code> settings, I initialize synchronization.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task sync init
Please confirm that you wish to upload all your pending tasks to the Taskserver (yes/no) yes
Syncing with freecinc.com:53589

Sync successful.  1516 changes uploaded.
</code></pre><p>Follow their instructions to set up any other machines you need connected to the Freecinc taskserver.</p>
<p>Once you go through all that work to set things up, how hard is it to <em>use</em> the <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/commands/synchronize.html">synchronize</a> command?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task log +taskwarrior set up freecinc
Logged task f053e7ab-1332-4131-8ceb-c2e121e8b00e.
$ task sync
Syncing with freecinc.com:53589

Sync successful.  1 changes uploaded.
</code></pre><p>That’s it. Run <code>task sync</code> occasionally and you’re golden.</p>
<h2 id="nits-and-tips">Nits and tips</h2>
<p>Task servers dramatically improve life with Taskwarrior. Some little annoyances become more apparent though. Let’s deal with those now.</p>
<h3 id="cutting-down-on-the-verbosity">Cutting down on the verbosity</h3>
<p>You get tired of this pretty quick:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>226 tasks, truncated to 61 lines
There are local changes.  Sync required.
</code></pre><p>The second you need to make a change, you get that message about local changes. Configure verbosity in your <code>.taskrc</code> if you don’t care about that particular update.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="na">verbose</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">blank,header,footnote,label,new-id,affected,edit,special,project,filter,unwait</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This removes messages about sync while leaving everything else. If you want more quiet, try <code>verbose=off</code> or even <code>verbose=nothing</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
See <code>man taskrc</code> for more details about Taskwarrior configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="sync-automatically-with-a-cron-job">Sync automatically with a cron job</h3>
<p>The hardest part of synchronization is remembering to do it. Let’s set up a <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux">cron</a> job so I don’t have to remember.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ crontab -e
</code></pre><p>Hourly should suffice. The <a href="https://crontab.guru/#0_*">https://crontab.guru/#0_*</a><em>*</em>*_*[crontab guru] says &ldquo;hourly&rdquo; would look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>0 * * * * /usr/bin/task sync
</code></pre><p>And that works. But I haven’t gotten around to setting up mail on that machine, so <code>cron</code> discards the output. I have no idea what the sync result was.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>0 * * * * { printf &#34;\%s: &#34; &#34;$(date &#34;+\%F \%T&#34;)&#34;; /usr/bin/task sync } &gt;&gt; /home/randomgeek/logs/task-sync.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre><p>This appends a timestamp and the result of <code>task sync</code> — including standard and error ouputs — to a log file.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>2020-01-26 16:00:00: Sync successful.  1 changes uploaded.
</code></pre><p><em>There</em> we go. I better turn this into a script before I get any more elaborate with it though. Except I have to go take care of something else.</p>
<p>No problem, I’ll make a task.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task add +ops +taskwarrior priority:M refactor sync cronjob to script
</code></pre>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Maybe I’ll add that task to my &ldquo;WorkSkills&rdquo; project. What if my fingers forget that the syntax is <code>project:WorkSkills</code>?</p>
<p>It happens. Frequently. Judge me all you want.</p>

<p>Fortunately I caught it quick, so I can fix my mistake with <code>undo</code>.</p>
<h2 id="undo"><code>undo</code></h2>
<p><code>task undo</code> reverts the last change you made, and can keep going back through your history one change at a time.</p>

The undo command is not reversible.  Are you sure you want to revert to the previous state? (yes/no) yes
Modified task reverted.
</code></pre><p>Taskwarrior tells me what values will be affected by an <code>undo</code>, which I find helpful. Yes, I want to restore previous state.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task 201 ls

ID  Tags  Description
201 learn Read &#34;Two Scoops of Django&#34;
</code></pre><p>Whew. All better.</p>
<p>History is a JSON stream in <code>~/.task/undo.data</code> if you’re curious. I don’t really know how far back it goes. I often miss my mistakes until after I made other changes that I’d rather not undo.</p>
<h2 id="append"><code>append</code></h2>
<p>My typos tend to happen when I’m on a roll. As a result, I don’t notice them until it’s far too late to <code>undo</code>. I use <code>append</code> for quick changes to reduce the risk of a typo making the description unrecognizable. It behaves like <code>modify</code> for adding and changing properties. However, anything interpreted as a description change gets tacked on the end of the current description by <code>append</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s the same project story as before, but with <code>append</code> instead of <code>modify</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task 201 append project WorkSkills
$ task 201 ls

ID  Tags  Description
201 learn Read &#34;Two Scoops of Django&#34; project WorkSkills
</code></pre><p>I still made my mistake, but at least I can find the task by its original description.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
<code>prepend</code> also exists, and is useful much the same way append is. Which you use is a matter of preference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what about bigger changes? Or what about when I change the description and don’t notice until a couple weeks later?</p>
<h2 id="edit"><code>edit</code></h2>
<p>The <code>edit</code> command loads the task details into a template, which it sends off to your <code>$EDITOR</code>. Once written, Taskwarrior updates the task to reflect changes.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019/09/attachments/img/2019/cover-2019-09-05.png" alt="Taskwarrior edit view"/></p>
<p>Those <code>✘</code> characters are just how I show trailing whitespace in Vim with <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Highlight_unwanted_spaces">listchars</a>. Anyways, I added &ldquo;WorkSkills&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Project&rdquo; line and fixed the description. There is even a line where I can add an annotation if I want, but not today. As soon as I save the file and quit my editor, Taskwarrior applies my changes.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task 201 ls

  <description>I went on a work trip to Las Vegas last weekend. I brought a couple shirts from my Design By Humans store, thinking my coworkers might appreciate them. They did! Turns out random strangers on the street also loved them! More than one asked for my business card. I have none, so those strangers needed to walk away empty handed.
I need to order business cards. I need to put together a simple design for them, maybe incorporating one of my drawings.</description>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Use Taskwarrior projects to organize closely related tasks!</h2><p><img src="/post/2019/02/../../../attachments/img/2019/cover-2019-02-16.png" alt="attachments/img/2019/cover-2019-02-16.png"/></p>
<p>I went on a work trip to Las Vegas last weekend. I brought a couple shirts from my <a href="https://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/randomgeek/">Design By Humans store</a>, thinking my coworkers might appreciate them. They did! Turns out random strangers on the street also loved them! More than one asked for my business card. I have none, so those strangers needed to walk away empty handed.</p>
<p>I need to order business cards. I need to put together a simple design for them, maybe incorporating one of my drawings. I should find out how much it costs for some cards — depending on how nice I want them. It might be a good idea to create a master store link here on the site. That way I can still use the cards if I use a different store.</p>
<p>This sounds like a project. Fortunately, <a href="/card/taskwarrior/">Taskwarrior</a> can help me track it. I mentioned projects at the <a href="/post/2017/12/taskwarrior/">beginning</a> of this series. It’s about time I tried understanding them a little better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-project-in-taskwarrior">What is a project in Taskwarrior</h2>
<p>A Taskwarrior project is a name that can be shared by many tasks, sort of like a tag. Unlike tags, each task can only have one project name at a time. This lets you collect closely related tasks under a single label.</p>
<h2 id="defining-a-project">Defining a project</h2>
<p>Every task has a <code>project</code> field, so all you must do to assign a project is give that field a value.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task add +social project:cards order business cards
$ task add project:cards +art draft design
Created task 107.
The project &#39;cards&#39; has changed.  Project &#39;cards&#39; is 0% complete (2 of 2 tasks remaining).
$ task add project:cards +money figure out pricing
Created task 108.
The project &#39;cards&#39; has changed.  Project &#39;cards&#39; is 0% complete (3 of 3 tasks remaining).
$ task add project:cards +site &#39;blog -&gt; store master link&#39;
Created task 109.
The project &#39;cards&#39; has changed.  Project &#39;cards&#39; is 0% complete (4 of 4 tasks remaining).
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Quote your project names if you want to use multiple words.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">task add +social project:<span class="s1">&#39;business cards&#39;</span> order business cards
</span></span></code></pre></div></blockquote>
<p>As you add and complete tasks in a project, Taskwarrior gives you a quick  summary of the project’s status. Taskwarrior includes a quick blurb about project status as you add and complete tasks in that project.</p>
<p>Projects work for these new tasks. They all work towards the same goal, even though there isn’t a clear <a href="/post/2018/02/setting-task-dependencies-in-taskwarrior/">dependency</a> between them. I suppose I could wait until I have the design, pricing, and link ready, but those other items can be finished in any order. To be honest, I don’t mess much with depends unless I need the reminder.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at those tasks. They’ll get lost with all the others, so filter by project name.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task project:cards
</code></pre><p><img src="/post/2019/02/attachments/img/2019/task-project-cards.png" alt="task report filtered to cards project"/></p>
<p>Since some tasks have a project, Taskwarrior creates a new column in the <code>next</code> report. There’s also a slight bump to Urgency when you define a project.</p>
<p>It’s often useful to see what active projects you have.</p>
<h2 id="listing-projects">Listing projects</h2>
<p>The <code>projects</code> report lists your projects with pending tasks, and the number of tasks for each project.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task projects
</code></pre><p><img src="/post/2019/02/attachments/img/2019/task-projects.png" alt="task projects listing"/></p>
<p>There’s also an entry for tasks that have no project, but fight the temptation to make a project for every task. That can end up making things more confusing.</p>
<h2 id="subprojects">Subprojects</h2>
<p>Notice how I have an &ldquo;Artbiz&rdquo; project? That’s supposed to be focusing on ways to make money with my art. That may or may not be a good thing to lump under a project, but there it is.</p>
<p>My cards project is obviously part of the broader &ldquo;Artbiz&rdquo; project, and I can show that with subprojects.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task project:cards modify project:Artbiz.cards
- Project will be changed from &#39;cards&#39; to &#39;Artbiz.cards&#39;.
Modify task 106 &#39;order business cards&#39;? (yes/no/all/quit) all
Modifying task 106 &#39;order business cards&#39;.
Modifying task 107 &#39;draft design&#39;.
Modifying task 108 &#39;figure out pricing&#39;.
Modifying task 109 &#39;blog -&gt; store master link&#39;.
Modified 4 tasks.
The project &#39;cards&#39; has changed.  Project &#39;cards&#39; is 0% complete (0 of 0 tasks remaining).
The project &#39;Artbiz.cards&#39; has changed.  Project &#39;Artbiz.cards&#39; is 0% complete (4 of 4 tasks remaining).
</code></pre><p>The period character separates the name of the main project from its subproject. Subprojects can have their own subprojects, but be careful about making your life too complicated. This is still just a single string of text, and a typo can create an unintended new project.</p>
<p>Then again — because it’s just a single string, it’s easy enough to change back with <code>modify</code>.</p>
<p>What does <code>projects</code> look like when you have subprojects? The subproject is listed beneath its main project, indented slightly to show the relation.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019/02/attachments/img/2019/task-projects-with-subproject.png" alt="task projects listing with a subproject"/></p>
<p>The <code>projects</code> report is useful as a minimal project listing, but what if you want more information?</p>
<h2 id="summarizing-tasks-by-project">Summarizing tasks by project</h2>
<p>That’s when you use the <code>summary</code> report.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task summary
</code></pre><p><img src="/post/2019/02/attachments/img/2019/task-summary.png" alt="task summary"/></p>
<p>The first two columns of <code>summary</code> give the same information as <code>projects</code>. You also get the average age of pending tasks in each project, and the percentage completed for each project, both as a number and as a progress bar!</p>
<p>Isn’t that cool?</p>
<p><em>I</em> think it’s cool, anyways.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>That about wraps it up for Taskwarrior projects. Oh I do have one more note.</p>
<p>I tried an experiment. Every task would get put into a project or subproject. I <em>thought</em> it would help me categorize my tasks with something broader than a tag. Something like how I use categories here. Then I could use project history to track my progress in these broad categories.</p>
<p>It didn’t work out like that.</p>
<p>Suddenly every task required additional work, limiting Taskwarrior’s utility for jotting down quick ideas. Even after creating a task, my urge to organize had me shuffling assigned projects for existing tasks. And what about completed tasks? Should I assign them to projects?</p>
<p>No. Basically, no. I quit the experiment.</p>
<p>Sometimes a TODO is just a TODO. Tags usually provide all you need to categorize tasks. Sometimes a project is described well enough by dependencies.</p>
<p>Do I still use projects? Sure! Usually well after task creation, when I see the relations better.</p>
<p>What rules do I use for projects now?</p>
<ul>
<li>If some tasks clearly contribute to the same specific goal, I might put them in a shared project.</li>
<li>Even though this site won’t end until I die, its tasks are already mentally slotted into an ongoing project. I reflect that with my Site project, with <em>occasional</em> subprojects for specific goals within the context of the Web site.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is enough advice from me. Do whatever works best for you.</p>
<p>Have fun! Get stuff done!</p>

  <description>[!NOTE] card/tldr Use the start, stop, and active Taskwarrior commands to manage what you’re doing right now.
I use Taskwarrior’s priority system to show what I want to be working on now. What if there are several things I want to be working on right now? Even with my priority rules, I still find myself drawn to the lower priority tasks that are more interesting. Realistically, I can only do one thing at a time.</description>

<p>I use Taskwarrior’s <a href="/post/2017/12/taskwarrior-priorities/">priority</a> system to show what I want to be working on now. What if there are several things I want to be working on right now? Even with my priority rules, I still find myself drawn to the lower priority tasks that are more interesting. Realistically, I can only do one thing at a time. How do I remind myself which task should have my active attention?</p>
<h2 id="task-start"><code>task start</code></h2>
<p>Easy! Use the <code>start</code> command.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task 72 start
</code></pre><p>This assigns the virtual tag <code>+ACTIVE</code> to the task. The regular task report highlights active tasks, as well as showing a new &ldquo;Active&rdquo; column indicating how long the task has been active.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task

</code></pre><p>Being active increases the urgency of a task, bubbling it up to the top in this report. I can also request to see <em>only</em> the active tasks.</p>
<h2 id="task-active"><code>task active</code></h2>
<p>The <code>active</code> report shows me only those tasks that have been assigned the <code>+ACTIVE</code> virtual tag. Very handy in my blog <a href="/post/2018/02/taskwarrior-contexts/">context</a>, when many curious ideas are tugging at my easily distracted brain and I need to see just what I’m doing.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task active

</code></pre><p>You can start as many tasks as you like. I find that distracting. Taskwarrior helps me focus, and starting a dozen different tasks feels like the opposite of focusing. I’ll limit <code>+ACTIVE</code> for <em>one</em> task that I intend to be working on <em>at this moment</em>.</p>
<h2 id="task-stop"><code>task stop</code></h2>
<p>I’m still writing this post, but I need to do something else real quick. I could just <code>start</code> that other task, but that blows a hole in my “one active task at a time” personal rule. Instead I’ll show that my attention is elsewhere with <code>stop</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task 72 stop

</code></pre><p>Even though there are timestamps in the task info, this is clumsy for time tracking. The Taskwarrior team also wrote <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/timewarrior">Timewarrior</a>, a command line tool dedicated to tracking and reporting time. It even hooks into Taskwarrior’s <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> commands, giving you time management with your task management.</p>
<p>I may explore Timewarrior eventually, but for now I am content using Taskwarrior alone to show what I’ve done with <code>completed</code>, what I’m doing right now with today’s new commands, and what I want to do (with everything else).</p>

<p>The report visually highlights the blocking task while downplaying the blocked task. This is easier to show with a screenshot.</p>

  <title>Post: Taskwarrior Contexts</title>

  <description>I manually applied tag filters to keep task listings relevant in my previous card/Taskwarrior posts, but Taskwarrior provides contexts to apply filters automatically. Let’s use those instead.
What is a context? Taskwarrior contexts are predefined filters appropriate to a particular set of circumstances. Once you define and load your context, Taskwarrior automatically applies the context’s filter for reporting. You can use them to focus on tasks important to those circumstances: work, craft projects, unsorted ideas, or home projects.</description>

Let’s use those instead.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-context">What is a context?</h2>
<p>Taskwarrior contexts are predefined filters appropriate to a particular set of circumstances. Once you define and load your context, Taskwarrior automatically applies the context’s filter for reporting. You can use them to focus on tasks important to those circumstances: work, craft projects, unsorted ideas, or home projects.</p>
<p>I removed sensitive tasks from <code>task</code> output with manual filters like <code>-work</code>. A special context for my blog would let me concentrate on writing instead of remembering that filter every time.</p>
<h2 id="using-contexts">Using contexts</h2>
<p>To create a context, use <code>context define</code> with its name and filter rules.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context define blog -work
Are you sure you want to add &#39;context.blog&#39; with a value of &#39;-work&#39;? (yes/no) yes
Context &#39;blog&#39; defined. Use &#39;task context blog&#39; to activate.
</code></pre><p>Now I have a context that includes everything but <code>+work</code> tasks. Perfect.</p>
<p>Maybe another context for <em>only</em> work tasks?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context define work +work
</code></pre><p>How do I get a handy list of created contexts?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context list

Name Definition Active
blog -work      no
work +work      no
</code></pre><p>I could get carried away with new contexts, but I’ll keep it to three for now: at work, on the blog, and <em>everywhere</em> — no context at all. I can add more later.</p>
<p>Before I start using the contexts, how many tasks do I have?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task count
153
</code></pre><p><a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/commands/count.html"><code>count</code></a> counts every task, including those that I completed or deleted. Let’s apply the <code>+PENDING</code> <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/tags.html#supported">virtual tag</a> to only count incomplete tasks.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task +PENDING count
63
</code></pre><p>With these numbers in my head, let’s set the “blog” context.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context blog
Context &#39;blog&#39; set. Use &#39;task context none&#39; to remove.
</code></pre><p>Now how many tasks do I have?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task count
112
$ task +PENDING count
53
</code></pre><p>Okay, I don’t have that many <code>+work</code> tags. It’s still nice not to worry about them when writing.</p>
<p>How do I see what context I am in? <code>context list</code> includes a column to show the active context.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context list

Name Definition Active
blog -work      yes
work +work      no
</code></pre><p>However, it might be clearer to show only the current context.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context show
Context &#39;blog&#39; with filter &#39;-work&#39; is currently applied.
</code></pre><p>Context affects reporting, but does not affect task creation. I can create a <code>+work</code> task from my &ldquo;blog&rdquo; context. It just won’t show up in any reports until I switch context.</p>
<p>Taskwarrior maintains context across shell sessions, so eventually I will want to clear the current context.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context none
</code></pre><p>I must confess something, dear reader. This post has been sitting as a draft for almost a month. My Taskwarrior usage evolved during that month. I create fewer <code>+work</code> tasks, because it often duplicated effort between Taskwarrior and the issue tracker used at work. I still have a few for side tasks that don’t fit neatly into work’s ticketing system. I don’t really have enough to merit a work context, though.</p>
<p>I may as well delete the “work” context.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task context delete work
Are you sure you want to remove &#39;context.work&#39;? (yes/no) yes
Context &#39;work&#39; deleted.
$ task context list

Name   Definition      Active
blog   -work           yes
bucket +idea -PRIORITY no
</code></pre><p>Oh yeah — the bucket. That’s new since I started this post.</p>
<p>I get a lot of ideas. Some of them are awful. Some of them seem worth doing. They all go in Taskwarrior. Every once in a while I sit down with a cup of coffee and sort through unexamined ideas: tasks tagged <code>+idea</code> and without an assigned priority. That’s what the “bucket” context is there for.</p>
<p>The interesting ideas get a priority — usually <code>L</code> unless they excite me. The uninteresting ones get deleted.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Have fun getting something done!</p>

&lt;p&gt;I checked out some library books again. Time to correctly record their due date in &lt;a href=&#34;https://randomgeekery.org/card/taskwarrior/&#34;&gt;Taskwarrior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I checked out some library books again. Time to correctly record their due date in <a href="/card/taskwarrior/">Taskwarrior</a>.</p>
<p>The Taskwarrior documentation includes an excellent page on <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/using_dates.html">using dates</a>. This post just takes what I need from that page.</p>
<h2 id="due-dates">Due dates</h2>
<p>Picked up some new stuff from the library the other day. Oh BTW I highly recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30139736-the-girl-from-the-other-side">The Girl from the Other Side</a>. I already finished the first volume and put the second on hold.</p>
<p>Anyways, this stuff is due on January 20th. Up until now I used <a href="/post/2017/12/taskwarrior-priorities/">annotations and priorities</a> to remind me about the urgency and any calendar-related details. That worked, in a clunky sort of way. I returned everything on time.</p>
<p>Thing is, Taskwarrior supports assigning due dates directly.</p>
<h3 id="add-a-due-date">Add a due date</h3>
<p>Give a task a due date with <code>due:</code> and a date. Taskwarrior lets you describe dates in <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/named_dates.html">many ways</a>. When in doubt, use <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task add return to library due:2018-01-20

  <description>task report with a column for priority levels
Merry Christmas! Time to organize my card/Taskwarrior tasks.
My more focused approach to Taskwarrior is working well. I add a task when I get an idea, and mark it done sometime after I finish. Annotations let me add noteworthy details. Tags and projects help both for organizing tasks and describing them. A task bubbles up to the top of task next as I add more information to it.</description>

</code></pre><p>That bubbling behavior gets in the way sometimes.</p>
<p>I created some tasks for playing with my Fitbit data and added relevant annotations. Taskwarrior follows a rule of &ldquo;it must be important if you’re talking so much about it,&rdquo;&quot; and dutifully puts those tasks high on the list.</p>
<p>Thing is, right now I care more about fixing my music library. Long story, but the moral of <em>that</em> tale is be careful with Beets and the <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4.6/plugins/duplicates.html">Duplicates</a> plugin. I have slightly different versions of the library on each of my machines, and a backup with all of the music but none of the Beets import information. I could make a project out of it, but it’s more of a thing I poke at when I can.</p>
<p>Anyways — I want my <code>next</code> report to more closely resemble my current priorities. I can do that by manually setting <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/priority.html">Priority</a> for each of my tasks.</p>
<h2 id="task-priority">Task priority</h2>
<p>Priority can be added to any task as an attribute, using <code>priority:</code> followed by the Priority you wish to assign. Priority also works as a filter for your reports.
The default choices are <code>H</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>L</code>, and none at all — to remove a Priority.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task add return library books priority:M

</code></pre><p>I see a new column reflecting that I now describe some tasks with Priority. Over on the end, <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/urgency.html">Urgency</a> jumps for tasks with any Priority at all. <code>H</code> Priority tasks get a large boost. But what do these Priority values <em>mean</em>?</p>
<p>Priority means something different for everyone. The basic idea is the higher a task’s Priority is, the more important it is to me.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use Priority values for now.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Priority</th>
<th>Represents</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>H</code></td>
<td>High</td>
<td>I am — or want to be — working on it right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>M</code></td>
<td>Medium</td>
<td>I want to work on this soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>Low</td>
<td>I want to work on this eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>empty</em></td>
<td>None</td>
<td>I haven’t thought about it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>My usage will change as I learn more about Taskwarrior but this works.</p>
<p>I don’t need to think too much about priority when I’m just adding to the idea bucket. Probably a good idea to periodically review unprioritized tasks and assign a Priority or delete them if they won’t ever be worth my time.</p>

  <description>task -work report showing everything but work tasks
I ended up with a mess after half a year trying to use every feature of card/Taskwarrior. It’s time to focus on building solid knowledge one step at a time.
I sat on this draft for a couple weeks. Rather than change task dates to make it look like I wrote this yesterday, I’ll leave task output as-is. Otherwise I’ll have to change those details every time I revisit Taskwarrior on the blog.</description>

<p>I ended up with a mess after half a year trying to use <em>every feature</em> of <a href="/card/taskwarrior/">card/Taskwarrior</a>. It’s time to focus on building solid knowledge one step at a time.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-taskwarrior">What Is Taskwarrior?</h2>
<p>Taskwarrior helps you manage tasks and ideas from the command line. It provides a convenient interface, assuming your idea of convenient is a rich collection of commands you can enter, customize, and pipe to other utilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] What&rsquo;s wrong with Org mode?
Nothing at all! <a href="/card/org/">card/Org</a> provides similar functionality and more for GNU Emacs users. Taskwarrior focuses narrowly on task management and reporting, while Org is also a time tracker, note-taking tool, markup language for publishing, and more.</p>
<p>Taskwarrior works better than Org mode for people that don’t live in Emacs. Wait. <a href="https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode">Vim-OrgMode</a> exists. I should be more general: Taskwarrior works better for people that don’t live in their editor.</p>
<p>Ultimately it comes down to personal taste.I enjoy using Taskwarrior today.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ task –-version

</code></pre><p>When you don’t tell <code>task</code> what you want, it assumes by default that you want to see your <code>next</code> report. You can customize many aspects of Taskwarrior, but for my own understanding I will not look at customization today.</p>

<p>Let’s review the <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/30second.html">30-Second Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Taskwarrior calculates <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/urgency.html">Urgency</a> based on multiple factors, including your own <code>priority:</code> ranking.

<p>It can be demoralizing to have one huge task that just sits there forever, even
though you work on it and make progress. A good way to keep yourself motivated is to split it into smaller subtasks. Taskwarrior does that with projects.</p>
<p>Let’s go with a knit vest that I have <em>almost</em> finished.</p>
