  <description>An attempt at sharing my notes online, like a more freeform version of what I did with coolnamehere. Mental friction of maintaining multiple sites resulted in me taking it down before it started to rot.
I liked the idea though, and shifted the angle into making my PKM the CMS for Random Geekery. I imported the posts into a new Obsidian vault, and refactored – extracting note cards from recurring topics, refactoring or removing some posts that no longer felt right as blog posts.</description>

<p>I liked the idea though, and shifted the angle into making my <a href="/card/pkm/">PKM</a> the <a href="/card/cms/">CMS</a> for <a href="/card/random-geekery/">Random Geekery</a>. I imported the posts into a new <a href="/card/obsidian/">Obsidian</a> vault, and refactored – extracting note cards from recurring topics, refactoring or removing some posts that no longer felt right as blog posts.</p>
<p>The note cards start out pretty raw, but that&rsquo;s okay. I fill them out with details from other PKM resources or fresh lookups as I need them.</p>
<p>Still ironing out the details of publishing the new hybrid site, but it currently involves <a href="/card/hugo/">Hugo</a>, <a href="/card/obsidian-export/">obsidian-export</a>, and some support scripts.</p>

  <description>The Swiss Army Chainsaw Programming Language
It’s not as cute as Ruby or as tidy as Python, but it’s always there. There have been numerous projects that are just plain easier in Perl. I can’t explain it.

  <description>A popular Programming Language to make fun of, and yet it persists.
It is easy to learn and easy to use. Of course, it is also easy to make a project that is so amazingly baroque that mere humans have no chance of ever editing it. This is a trait that PHP shares with one of its one-time biggest rivals, Perl. It was funny to listen to arguments between PHP and Perl folks about why their favorite is the best and the other is the worst.</description>

<p>It is easy to learn and easy to use. Of course, it is also easy to make a project that is so amazingly baroque that mere humans have no chance of ever editing it. This is a trait that PHP shares with one of its one-time biggest rivals, <a href="/card/perl/">Perl</a>. It was funny to listen to arguments between PHP and Perl folks about why their favorite is the best and the other is the worst. The other was always “unstructured and unsuitable for real projects”, while the favorite was “fast and expressive.”</p>
<p>These folks need to settle down, because they’re both right. Perl and PHP show an obvious influence from the world of shell scripting, where the goal is to get stuff done now. This means that you can put together a project with amazing speed, but it takes a lot of discipline to keep your code in a clean, maintainable state. You could say that about lots of languages, though. My advice is that you go with PHP if that’s your preference. Don’t let anybody bother you about your choice. It’s a regular part of my site-building toolkit, and I’m pretty much guilt-free about it.</p>
